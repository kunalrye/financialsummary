Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 28, 2018 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise noted, considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018. Significant Accounting PoliciesExcept for the accounting policy for revenue recognition, which was updated as a result of adopting a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners’ activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. 7NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post contract customer support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Fiscal YearWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 are both 52-week years. The second quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were both 13-week quarters.ReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.Principles of ConsolidationOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries. We adopted this guidance on January 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. We are now required to recognize changes in the fair value of our equity investments through net income rather than other comprehensive income. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet AdoptedIn February 2016 and July 2018, the FASB issued accounting standards updates regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for lease terms of more than 12 months. The FASB also recently provided a practical expedient transition method to adopt the new lease accounting requirements. We are evaluating the impact of adopting the new lease accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements, systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements. The updates will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. We expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 8NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 2 - New Revenue Accounting StandardMethod and Impact of AdoptionOn January 29, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied it to contracts that were not completed as of that date. Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of the new standard as a $7 million increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax. Comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted. The impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 was not significant. Deferred Revenue and Performance ObligationsDeferred revenue is comprised mainly of customer advances and deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS related to software licensing. The following table shows the changes in deferred revenue during the first half of fiscal year 2019: July 29, 2018 (In millions)Balance as of January 28, 2018$68Adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption of new revenue standard(5)Balance as of January 29, 201863Deferred revenue added during the period194Revenue recognized during the period(153)Balance as of July 29, 2018$104Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted license and development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized. As of July 29, 2018, the amount of our remaining performance obligations that have not been recognized as revenue was $235 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 50% as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.Refer to Note 15 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including disaggregated revenue disclosures.Note 3 - Stock-Based CompensationOur stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 29, 2018 July 30, 2017 July 29, 2018 July 30, 2017 (In millions)Cost of revenue$8 $4 $16 $8Research and development76 44 150 85Sales, general and administrative48 33 96 65Total$132 $81 $262 $158 9NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Equity Award ActivityThe following is a summary of equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs, and Market-based PSUs Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share (In millions, except per share data)Balances, January 28, 201822 $66.72Granted (1) (2)1 $240.22Vested restricted stock(5) $39.64Canceled and forfeited— $—Balances, July 29, 201818 $84.56(1)Includes the number of PSUs granted that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum corporate financial performance goal for fiscal year 2019 is achieved. Depending on the actual level of the corporate performance achievement at the end of fiscal year 2019, the PSUs issued could be up to 0.3 million shares.(2)Includes the number of market-based PSUs granted that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum goal for total shareholder return, or TSR, over the 3-year measurement period is achieved. Depending on the ranking of our TSR compared to those of the companies comprising the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index during that period, the market-based PSUs issued could be up to 45 thousand shares.Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $12 million and $31 million, respectively. Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $10 million and $39 million, respectively. The following summarizes the aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense and estimated weighted average amortization period as of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018: July 29, January 28, 2018 2018 (In millions)Aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense$1,048 $1,091    Estimated weighted average remaining amortization period(In years)RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs2.1 2.3ESPP0.9 0.7 10NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 4 – Net Income Per ShareThe following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended July 29, July 30, July 29, July 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In millions, except per share data)Numerator:       Net income$1,101 $583 $2,345 $1,091Denominator:       Basic weighted average shares607 597 607 595Dilutive impact of outstanding securities:       Equity awards18 26 19 261.00% Convertible Senior Notes1 4 1 9Warrants issued with the 1.00% ConvertibleSenior Notes— 6 — 7Diluted weighted average shares626 633 627 637Net income per share:       Basic (1)$1.81 $0.98 $3.86 $1.83Diluted (2)$1.76 $0.92 $3.74 $1.71Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive— — 1 1(1)Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.(2)Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018, or the Convertible Notes, are included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Convertible Notes have a dilutive impact on net income per share if our average stock price for the reporting period exceeds the adjusted conversion price of $20.02 per share. The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding are also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. As of July 29, 2018, there were no warrants outstanding.Refer to Note 12 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes and Note Hedges.Note 5 – Income TaxesWe recognized income tax expense of $79 million and $146 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and $101 million and $130 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 was 6.7% and 5.9%, respectively, and 14.8% and 10.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.Our effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 of 5.9% and 10.7%, respectively, were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rates of 21% and 33.9%, for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to higher income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit. 11NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)In December 2017, the SEC issued guidance that allows companies to record provisional amounts for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Job Acts, or TCJA, during a measurement period not to exceed one year. The TCJA was effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and we have recorded provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we have not recorded any adjustments to our provisional amounts. We will continue our analysis of these provisional amounts, which are still subject to change during the measurement period based on further guidance on accounting interpretations from the FASB and application of the law from the U.S. Department of Treasury, including proposed regulations relating to the one-time transition tax issued on August 1, 2018.The TCJA subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. Under U.S. GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Given the complexity of the GILTI provisions, we are still evaluating its effects and have not yet determined our accounting policy. We expect to complete our analysis within the measurement period. For the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, because we are still evaluating the effects of the GILTI provisions, we have included tax expense related to GILTI for current-year operations in our estimated annual effective tax rate and have not provided for GILTI on deferred items.For the first half of fiscal year 2019, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. Additionally, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of July 29, 2018, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.On August 1, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of the Treasury issued proposed regulations relating to the one-time transition tax provision of the TCJA. Any required adjustment must be recorded during the measurement period as determined in accordance with the SEC guidance. While we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the regulations, we expect to record a discrete tax benefit in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to our provisional U.S. tax reform transition tax amount.  12NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 6 - Marketable Securities Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” debt securities.The following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018: July 29, 2018 AmortizedCost UnrealizedGain UnrealizedLoss EstimatedFair Value Reported as     Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities (In millions)Corporate debt securities$2,491 $1 $(8) $2,484 $— $2,484Debt securities issued by the United States Treasury2,412 — (2) 2,410 — 2,410Debt securities of United States government agencies1,993 — (6) 1,987 — 1,987Money market funds483 — — 483 483 —Asset-backed securities206 — (2) 204 — 204Mortgage-backed securities issued by United States government-sponsored enterprises107 2 (1) 108 — 108Foreign government bonds32 — — 32 — 32Total$7,724 $3 $(19) $7,708 $483 $7,225 January 28, 2018 AmortizedCost UnrealizedGain UnrealizedLoss EstimatedFair Value Reported as     Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities (In millions)Money market funds$3,789 $— $— $3,789 $3,789 $—Corporate debt securities1,304 — (9) 1,295 — 1,295Debt securities of United States government agencies822 — (7) 815 — 815Debt securities issued by the United States Treasury577 — (4) 573 — 573Asset-backed securities254 — (2) 252 — 252Mortgage-backed securities issued by United States government-sponsored enterprises128 2 — 130 — 130Foreign government bonds42 — (1) 41 — 41Total$6,916 $2 $(23) $6,895 $3,789 $3,106The following table provides the breakdown of unrealized losses as of July 29, 2018, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position:  Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Estimated Fair       Value GrossUnrealizedLosses Estimated Fair      Value GrossUnrealizedLosses Estimated Fair          Value GrossUnrealizedLosses (In millions)Debt securities issued by United States government agencies$925 $(1) $559 $(5) $1,484 $(6)Debt securities issued by the United States Treasury754 — 410 (2) 1,164 (2)Corporate debt securities310 (1) 742 (7) 1,052 (8)Asset-backed securities49 (1) 155 (1) 204 (2)Mortgage-backed securities issued by United States government-sponsored enterprises15 — 31 (1) 46 (1)Foreign government bonds— — 31 — 31 — $2,053 $(3) $1,928 $(16) $3,981 $(19)The gross unrealized losses related to fixed income securities were primarily due to changes in interest rates, which we believe are temporary in nature.

Amortization expense associated with intangible assets was $6 million and $17 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and $14 million and $29 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively. Future amortization expense related to the net carrying amount of intangible assets as of July 29, 2018 is estimated to be $12 million for the remainder of fiscal year 2019, $20 million in fiscal year 2020, $11 million in fiscal year 2021, $4 million in fiscal year 2022, $3 million in fiscal year 2023, and $1 million in fiscal 2024. 14NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 9 - Balance Sheet Components Certain balance sheet components are as follows: July 29, January 28, 2018 2018Inventories:(In millions)Raw materials$421 $227Work in-process266 192Finished goods403 377Total inventories$1,090 $796As of July 29, 2018, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $1.91 billion. July 29, January 28, 2018 2018Accrued and Other Current Liabilities:(In millions)Customer program accruals$248 $181Accrued payroll and related expenses170 172Deferred revenue (1)77 53Taxes payable39 33Coupon interest on debt obligations20 20Accrued royalties19 17Warranty accrual (2)16 15Professional service fees15 15Other44 36Total accrued and other current liabilities$648 $542(1)Deferred revenue primarily includes customer advances and deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS.(2)Refer to Note 11 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion regarding warranties. July 29, January 28, 2018 2018Other Long-Term Liabilities:(In millions)Income tax payable (1)$544 $559Deferred revenue (2)27 15Deferred income tax liability21 18Employee benefits liability18 12Deferred rent14 9Other14 19Total other long-term liabilities$638 $632(1)As of July 29, 2018, represents the long-term portion of the one-time transition tax payable of $337 million, as well as unrecognized tax benefits of $191 million and related interest and penalties of $16 million. (2)Deferred revenue primarily includes deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS.Note 10 - Derivative Financial InstrumentsWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses. We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive  15NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018.We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018: July 29, 2018 January 28, 2018 (In millions)Designated as cash flow hedges$396 $104Not designated for hedge accounting$92 $94As of July 29, 2018, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.During the second quarter and first half of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.Note 11 - GuaranteesU.S. GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee.Accrual for Product Warranty LiabilitiesWe record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. Additionally, we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities was $16 million and $15 million as of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018, respectively.In connection with certain agreements that we have entered into in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.Note 12 - DebtLong-Term Debt2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year, beginning on March 16, 2017. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs. 16NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows:  ExpectedRemaining Term (years) EffectiveInterest Rate July 29, 2018 January 28, 2018      (In millions)2.20% Notes Due 2021 3.1 2.38% $1,000 $1,0003.20% Notes Due 2026 8.1 3.31% 1,000 1,000Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs     (13) (15)Net carrying amount     $1,987 $1,985Convertible Debt1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. Through the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we had settled an aggregate of $1.49 billion of the Convertible Notes. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 and we had $14 million in principal amount outstanding as of July 29, 2018. Effective August 1, 2018, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes before the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2018 regardless of conversion conditions.During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we paid cash to settle an insignificant amount of the Convertible Notes. Subsequently, we received additional conversion notices for an aggregate of $11 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes which are expected to be settled in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we also issued one thousand shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value and the related loss on early conversions was not significant. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $252.02 on the last trading day of the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, the if-converted value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $162 million. As of July 29, 2018, the conversion rate was 49.94 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes.Note HedgesConcurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges have an adjusted strike price of $20.02 per share and allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would deliver and/or pay, respectively, to the holders of the Convertible Notes upon conversion. Through July 29, 2018, we had received 56 million shares of our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of $1.49 billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes.Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million. As of July 29, 2018, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement.Commercial PaperWe have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of July 29, 2018, we had not issued any commercial paper. 17NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 13 - Commitments and ContingenciesLitigationPolaris Innovations LimitedOn May 16, 2016, Polaris Innovations Limited, or Polaris, a non-practicing entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.), filed a complaint against NVIDIA for patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Polaris alleges that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe six U.S. patents relating to the control of dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against NVIDIA. On September 14, 2016, NVIDIA answered the Polaris Complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the six Polaris patents.On December 5, 2016, the Texas Court granted NVIDIA’s motion to transfer and ordered the case transferred to the Northern District of California.Between December 7, 2016 and July 25, 2017, NVIDIA filed multiple petitions for inter partes review, or IPR, at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the U.S. litigation. The USPTO instituted IPRs for four U.S. patents and declined to institute IPRs on two U.S. patents. The USPTO issued a Final Written Decision on the IPR relating to one of the patents on June 19, 2018, finding claims 1-23 and 28 unpatentable but that claims 24-27 were not proved unpatentable.On June 15, 2017, the California Court granted NVIDIA’s motion to stay the district court litigation pending resolution of the petitions for IPR. The California Court has not set a trial date.On December 30, 2016, Polaris filed a complaint against NVIDIA for patent infringement in the Regional Court of Düsseldorf, Germany. Polaris alleges that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe three patents relating to control of DRAM. On July 14, 2017, NVIDIA filed defenses to the infringement allegations including non-infringement with respect to each of the three asserted patents. An oral hearing is scheduled for February 21, 2019.Between March 31, 2017 and June 12, 2017, NVIDIA filed nullity actions with the German Patent Court challenging the validity of each of the patents asserted by Polaris in the German litigation.ZiiLabs 1 Patents LawsuitOn October 2, 2017, ZiiLabs Inc., Ltd., or ZiiLabs, a non-practicing entity, filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has infringed and is continuing to infringe four U.S. patents relating to GPUs, or the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. ZiiLabs is a Bermuda corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Asia Limited, a Hong Kong company which is itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Ltd., a publicly traded Singapore company. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or direct infringement of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. On November 27, 2017, NVIDIA answered the ZiiLabs complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents.On January 10, 2018, ZiiLabs filed a first amended complaint asserting infringement of a fifth U.S. patent.On February 22, 2018, the Delaware Court stayed the ZiiLabs 1 case pending the resolution of the ITC investigation over the ZiiLabs 2 patents.ZiiLabs 2 Patents LawsuitsOn December 27, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a second complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has infringed four additional U.S. patents, or the ZiiLabs 2 Patents. The second complaint also seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or direct infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents.On February 22, 2018, the Delaware Court stayed the district court action on the ZiiLabs 2 patents pending the resolution of the ITC Investigation over the ZiiLabs 2 patents. 18NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)On December 29, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a request with the U.S. International Trade Commission, or USITC, to commence an Investigation pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 relating to the unlawful importation of certain graphics processors and products containing the same. ZiiLabs alleges that the unlawful importation results from the infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents by products from respondents NVIDIA, ASUSTeK Computer Inc., ASUS Computer International, EVGA Corporation, Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd., G.B.T. Inc., Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., MSI Computer Corp., Nintendo Co., Ltd., Nintendo of America Inc., PNY Technologies Inc., Zotac International (MCO) Ltd., and Zotac USA Inc.On February 28, 2018, NVIDIA and the other respondents answered the ITC complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the four asserted ZiiLabs 2 patents.On May 10, 2018, the Administrative Law Judge presiding over the investigation issued an Initial Determination terminating the investigation with respect to one of the patents.  On July 17, 2018, the USITC affirmed this decision on modified grounds.Accounting for Loss ContingenciesWhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe the claims made by the other parties in the above ongoing matters are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend the actions. As of July 29, 2018, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in other legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of its business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.Note 14 - Shareholders’ Equity Capital Return Program Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.During the first half of fiscal year 2019, we repurchased a total of 3 million shares for $655 million. During the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, we also paid $91 million and $182 million, respectively, in cash dividends to our shareholders.Through July 29, 2018, we have repurchased an aggregate of 254 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $6.16 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of July 29, 2018, we were authorized, subject to certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.16 billion through December 2020.Preferred StockAs of July 29, 2018 and January 28, 2018, there were no shares of preferred stock outstanding.Common StockWe are authorized to issue up to 2.00 billion shares of our common stock at $0.001 per share par value.Note 15 - Segment InformationOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments. We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying architecture. While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for artificial intelligence, or AI, data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices.  19NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most. The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, product warranty charge, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for NVIDIA as a whole.

We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtual reality, high performance computing, or HPC, and artificial intelligence, or AI.Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying architecture. From our proprietary processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive.While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. 22Recent Developments, Future Objectives and ChallengesSecond Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019 Summary Three Months Ended     July 29, 2018 April 29, 2018 July 30, 2017 Quarter-over-Quarter Change Year-over-Year Change ($ in millions, except per share data)    Revenue$3,123 $3,207 $2,230 (3)% 40%Gross margin63.3% 64.5% 58.4% (120) bps 490 bpsOperating expenses$818 $773 $614 6 % 33%Income from operations$1,157 $1,295 $688 (11)% 68%Net income$1,101 $1,244 $583 (11)% 89%Net income per diluted share$1.76 $1.98 $0.92 (11)% 91%Revenue for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 increased 40% year over year and decreased 3% sequentially. Each of our market platforms - gaming, professional visualization, datacenter, and automotive - produced sequential and year-over-year growth.GPU business revenue was $2.66 billion, up 40% from a year earlier and down 4% sequentially, led by gaming, professional visualization, and datacenter, offsetting a substantial decline in cryptocurrency GPUs. Gaming revenue was $1.80 billion, up 52% from a year ago and up 5% sequentially. Gaming GPU growth was fueled by Pascal-based GPUs for desktops and by high-performance notebooks based on our Max-Q technology. Professional visualization revenue was $281 million, up 20% from a year earlier and up 12% sequentially. Datacenter revenue was $760 million, up 83% from a year ago and up 8% sequentially, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems. OEM and IP revenue was $116 million, down 54% from a year ago and down 70% sequentially, driven by lower demand for GPUs for cryptocurrency mining. Cryptocurrency-related revenue included in OEM was $18 million, and we expect it to be negligible going forward.Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes Automotive, SOC modules for the Nintendo Switch gaming console, and other embedded Tegra platforms - was $467 million, up 40% from a year ago and up 6% sequentially.  Automotive revenue of $161 million was up 13% from a year earlier and up 11% sequentially, incorporating infotainment modules, production DRIVE PX platforms, and development agreements with automotive companies. Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was 63.3%. Gross margin is normalizing to our core business and includes only minor benefits from cryptocurrency mining demand.Operating expenses for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $818 million, up 33% from a year earlier and up 6% sequentially, reflecting increased headcount and related costs for our growth initiatives - gaming, AI, and autonomous driving.Income from operations for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 was $1.16 billion, up 68% from a year earlier and down 11% sequentially. Net income and net income per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $1.10 billion and $1.76, respectively, up 89% and 91%, respectively, from a year earlier, fueled by strong revenue growth and improved gross and operating margins. During the first half of fiscal year 2019, we returned $837 million to shareholders through a combination of $655 million in share repurchases and $182 million in cash dividends. For fiscal year 2019, we intend to return $1.25 billion to shareholders through ongoing quarterly cash dividends and share repurchases.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.94 billion as of July 29, 2018, compared with $7.30 billion at the end of the prior quarter. The sequential increase was primarily related to second quarter operating income, partially offset by changes in working capital.GPU BusinessDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we marked the launch of the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, powered by NVIDIA Volta Tensor Core GPUs; introduced NVIDIA HGX-2, a unified computing platform for both AI and high performance computing; announced that five of the world’s seven fastest supercomputers are powered by  23NVIDIA GPUs; introduced the NVIDIA HGX-2 platform for both AI and HPC; and launched AIRI Mini with Pure Storage and ONTAP AI with NetApp for implementing and scaling deep learning.

Interest income was $32 million and $15 million during the second quarter of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $57 million and $31 million during the first half of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing securities, as well as higher purchased yields. Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to the 2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026 issued in September 2016, and the 1.00% Convertible Notes Due 2018, or the Convertible Notes, issued in December 2013. Interest expense was $14 million and $15 million during the second quarter of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $29 million and $31 million during the first half of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.Other, NetOther, net, consists primarily of realized or unrealized gains and losses from non-affiliated investments, losses on early debt conversions of the Convertible Notes, and the impact of changes in foreign currency rates. Other, net, was not significant during the second quarter or the first half of fiscal year 2019. Other, net, was not significant during the second quarter of  26fiscal year 2018 and $21 million of expense during the first half of fiscal year 2018, consisting primarily of $17 million of losses recognized from early conversions of the Convertible Notes during the first half of fiscal year 2018.Income TaxesWe recognized income tax expense of $79 million and $146 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and $101 million and $130 million for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively. Income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 was 6.7% and 5.9%, respectively, and 14.8% and 10.7% for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2018, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the second quarter and first half of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.Refer to Note 5 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.Liquidity and Capital Resources  July 29, 2018 January 28, 2018 (In millions)Cash and cash equivalents$718 $4,002Marketable securities7,225 3,106Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$7,943 $7,108 Six Months Ended July 29, 2018 July 30, 2017 (In millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$2,358 $987Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities$(4,356) $1,016Net cash used in financing activities$(1,286) $(1,781)As of July 29, 2018, we had $7.94 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $835 million from the end of fiscal year 2018.

As of July 29, 2018, there have been no material changes to the foreign exchange rate risks described as of January 28, 2018.Refer to Note 10 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESControls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on their evaluation as of July 29, 2018, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.PART II. OTHER INFORMATIONITEM 1.

RISK FACTORSRefer to the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018. There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, which could cause our stock price to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. 29ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDSIssuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesBeginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock. In November 2016, the Board authorized an additional $2.00 billion under our repurchase program and extended it through December 2020.Since the inception of our share repurchase program, we have repurchased an aggregate of 254 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $6.16 billion through July 29, 2018. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. As of July 29, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $1.16 billion through December 2020.The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be made in one or more larger repurchases. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion.We had no share repurchase transactions during the second quarter of fiscal year 2019.Transactions Related to our Convertible Notes and Note HedgesDuring the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we issued one thousand shares of our common stock upon settlement of Convertible Notes submitted for conversion. In connection with these conversions, we exercised a portion of our Note Hedges to acquire an equal number of shares of our common stock. The counterparty to the Note Hedges may be deemed an “affiliated purchaser” and may have purchased the shares of our common stock deliverable to us upon this exercise of our option. Subsequently, we received additional conversion notices for an aggregate of $11 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes, which are expected to be settled in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. The actual number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based upon the terms of the Convertible Notes. We expect to receive an equal number of shares of our common stock under the terms of the Note Hedges. Refer to Note 12 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Convertible Notes and the Note Hedges.Restricted Stock Unit Share WithholdingWe also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock unit awards under our employee equity incentive program. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we withheld approximately 0.3 million shares at a total cost of $66 million through net share settlements. During the first half of fiscal year 2019, we withheld approximately 2.1 million shares at a total cost of $515 million through net share settlements.
