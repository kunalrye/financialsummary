Summary of Significant Accounting PoliciesBasis of PresentationThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 28, 2018 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018, as filed with the SEC, but does not include all disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments except as otherwise noted, considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included. The results for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018. Significant Accounting PoliciesExcept for the accounting policy for revenue recognition, which was updated as a result of adopting a new accounting standard related to revenue recognition, there have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018.Revenue RecognitionWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, and software licensing. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (5) recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.Product Sales RevenueRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.For products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized, based primarily on historical return rates. However, if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.Our customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are earmarked for market segment development and are designed to support our partners' activities while also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers. License and Development ArrangementsOur license and development arrangements with customers typically require significant customization of our intellectual property components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a single performance obligation over the period in which the development services are performed. We measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period. 7NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Software LicensingOur software licenses provide our customers with a right to use the software when it is made available to the customer. Customers may purchase either perpetual licenses or subscriptions to licenses, which differ mainly in the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Software licenses are frequently sold along with post-contract customer support, or PCS. For such arrangements, we allocate revenue to the software license and PCS on a relative standalone selling price basis by maximizing the use of observable inputs to determine the standalone selling price for each performance obligation. Revenue from software licenses is recognized up front when the software is made available to the customer. PCS revenue is recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed.Fiscal YearWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2019 and 2018 are both 52-week years. The third quarters of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were both 13-week quarters.ReclassificationsCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.Principles of ConsolidationOur condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories, income taxes, goodwill, stock-based compensation, litigation, investigation and settlement costs, restructuring and other charges, and other contingencies. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting PronouncementsRecently Adopted Accounting PronouncementsThe Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting standards update that creates a single source of revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP for all companies, in all industries. We adopted this guidance on January 29, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach. Refer to Note 2 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to amend certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. We are now required to recognize changes in the fair value of our equity investments through net income rather than other comprehensive income. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and applied it prospectively. The adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.Recent Accounting Pronouncement Not Yet AdoptedIn February 2016 and July 2018, the FASB issued accounting standards updates regarding the accounting for leases by which we will begin recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for lease terms of more than 12 months. The FASB also recently provided a practical expedient transition method to adopt the new lease accounting requirements. We are evaluating the impact of adopting the new lease accounting standards on our consolidated financial statements, systems and processes in conjunction with our review of lease agreements. The updates will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. We expect the adoption of this accounting guidance to result in an increase in lease assets and a corresponding increase in lease liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 8NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 2 - New Revenue Accounting StandardMethod and Impact of AdoptionOn January 29, 2018, we adopted the new revenue accounting standard using the modified retrospective method and applied it to contracts that were not completed as of that date. Upon adoption, we recognized the cumulative effect of the new standard as a $7 million increase to opening retained earnings, net of tax. Comparative information for prior periods has not been adjusted. The impact of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 was not significant. Deferred Revenue and Performance ObligationsDeferred revenue is comprised mainly of customer advances and deferrals related to license and development arrangements and PCS related to software licensing. The following table shows the changes in deferred revenue during the first nine months of fiscal year 2019: October 28, 2018 (In millions)Balance as of January 28, 2018$68Adjustment to retained earnings upon adoption of new revenue standard(5)Balance as of January 29, 201863Deferred revenue added during the period271Revenue recognized during the period(214)Balance as of October 28, 2018$120Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted license and development arrangements and PCS that has not been recognized. As of October 28, 2018, the amount of our remaining performance obligations that has not been recognized as revenue was $237 million, of which we expect to recognize approximately 50% as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.Refer to Note 15 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information, including disaggregated revenue disclosures. 9NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 3 - Stock-Based CompensationOur stock-based compensation expense is associated with restricted stock units, or RSUs, performance stock units that are based on our corporate financial performance targets, or PSUs, performance stock units that are based on market conditions, or market-based PSUs, and our employee stock purchase plan, or ESPP.Our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income include stock-based compensation expense, net of amounts allocated to inventory, as follows: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 28, 2018 October 29, 2017 October 28, 2018 October 29, 2017 (In millions)Cost of revenue$5 $6 $21 $14Research and development88 61 237 146Sales, general and administrative47 40 142 105Total$140 $107 $400 $265Equity Award ActivityThe following is a summary of equity award transactions under our equity incentive plans: RSUs, PSUs, and Market-based PSUs Outstanding Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant-Date Fair Value Per Share (In millions, except per share data)Balances, January 28, 201822 $66.72Granted (1) (2)4 $262.44Vested restricted stock(10) $47.61Canceled and forfeited— $—Balances, October 28, 201816 $127.89(1)Includes the number of PSUs granted that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum corporate financial performance goal for fiscal year 2019 is achieved. Depending on the actual level of the corporate performance achievement at the end of fiscal year 2019, the PSUs issued could be up to 0.3 million shares.(2)Includes the number of market-based PSUs granted that will be issued and eligible to vest if the maximum goal for total shareholder return, or TSR, over the 3-year measurement period is achieved. Depending on the ranking of our TSR compared to those of the companies comprising the Standard & Poor's 500 Index during that period, the market-based PSUs issued could be up to 45 thousand shares.Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $73 million and $89 million, respectively. Of the total fair value of equity awards granted during the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, we estimated that the stock-based compensation expense related to equity awards that are not expected to vest was $105 million and $144 million, respectively.  10NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)The following summarizes the aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense and estimated weighted average amortization period as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018: October 28, January 28, 2018 2018 (In millions)Aggregate unearned stock-based compensation expense$1,608 $1,091    Estimated weighted average remaining amortization period(In years)RSUs, PSUs, and market-based PSUs2.4 2.3ESPP0.9 0.7Note 4 – Net Income Per ShareThe following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic and diluted net income per share computations for the periods presented: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended October 28, October 29, October 28, October 29, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (In millions, except per share data)Numerator:       Net income$1,230 $838 $3,575 $1,928Denominator:       Basic weighted average shares609 603 608 597Dilutive impact of outstanding securities:       Equity awards16 23 18 241.00% Convertible Senior Notes— 2 — 7Warrants issued with the 1.00% ConvertibleSenior Notes— — — 5Diluted weighted average shares625 628 626 633Net income per share:       Basic (1)$2.02 $1.39 $5.88 $3.23Diluted (2)$1.97 $1.33 $5.71 $3.05Equity awards excluded from diluted net income per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive3 3 4 4(1)Calculated as net income divided by basic weighted average shares.(2)Calculated as net income divided by diluted weighted average shares.The 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018, or the Convertible Notes, were included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. The Convertible Notes had a dilutive impact on net income per share as our average stock price for the reporting period exceeded the adjusted conversion price of $20.02 per share. The warrants associated with our Convertible Notes, or the Warrants, outstanding were also included in the calculation of diluted net income per share. As of October 28, 2018, there were no warrants outstanding.Refer to Note 12 of these Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion regarding the Convertible Notes. 11NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 5 – Income TaxesWe recognized an income tax benefit of $149 million and $3 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and income tax expense of $58 million and $189 million for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, respectively. Income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 13.8% and nominal for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, respectively, and income tax expense as a percentage of income before tax was 6.5% and 8.9% for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2018, respectively. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 as compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% as a result of U.S. tax reform, and a $138 million reduction in our provisional U.S. tax reform transition tax amount in the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, partially offset by a decrease in the impact of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.Our effective tax rates for the first nine months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018 were nominal and 8.9%, respectively, and were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rates of 21% and 33.9%, for fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively, due to income earned in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, the benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit, and for fiscal year 2019, the reduction in our provisional U.S. tax reform transition tax amount.In December 2017, the SEC issued guidance that allows companies to record provisional amounts for the tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Job Acts, or TCJA, during a measurement period not to exceed one year. The TCJA was effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018 and we have recorded provisional amounts based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we reduced our provisional transition tax amount based on proposed regulations issued on August 1, 2018. We expect to complete our analysis of these provisional amounts in our fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 based on further guidance on accounting interpretations from the FASB and application of the law from the U.S. Department of Treasury, which may further impact our provisional estimates.The TCJA subjects a U.S. corporation to tax on its global intangible low-taxed income, or GILTI. Under U.S. GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI as a current period expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. Given the complexity of the GILTI provisions, we are still evaluating its effects and have not yet determined our accounting policy. We expect to complete our analysis in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019. For the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, as we are still evaluating the effects of the GILTI provisions, we have included tax expense related to GILTI for current-year operations in our estimated annual effective tax rate and have not provided for GILTI on deferred items.For the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions. Additionally, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal year ended January 28, 2018, other than the aforementioned reduction in our provisional U.S. tax reform transition tax amount.While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of October 28, 2018, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. 12NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 6 - Marketable Securities Our cash equivalents and marketable securities are classified as “available-for-sale” debt securities.The following is a summary of cash equivalents and marketable securities as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018: October 28, 2018 AmortizedCost UnrealizedGain UnrealizedLoss EstimatedFair Value Reported as     Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities (In millions)Corporate debt securities$2,732 $1 $(6) $2,727 $— $2,727Debt securities of United States government agencies2,140 — (5) $2,135 — 2,135Debt securities issued by the United States Treasury1,544 — (2) 1,542 — 1,542Money market funds602 — — 602 602 —Foreign government bonds191 — — 191 — 191Asset-backed securities178 — (2) 176 — 176Mortgage-backed securities issued by United States government-sponsored enterprises98 1 — 99 — 99Total$7,485 $2 $(15) $7,472 $602 $6,870 January 28, 2018 AmortizedCost UnrealizedGain UnrealizedLoss EstimatedFair Value Reported as     Cash Equivalents Marketable Securities (In millions)Money market funds$3,789 $— $— $3,789 $3,789 $—Corporate debt securities1,304 — (9) 1,295 — 1,295Debt securities of United States government agencies822 — (7) 815 — 815Debt securities issued by the United States Treasury577 — (4) 573 — 573Asset-backed securities254 — (2) 252 — 252Mortgage-backed securities issued by United States government-sponsored enterprises128 2 — 130 — 130Foreign government bonds42 — (1) 41 — 41Total$6,916 $2 $(23) $6,895 $3,789 $3,106The following table provides the breakdown of unrealized losses as of October 28, 2018, aggregated by investment category and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position:  Less than 12 Months 12 Months or Greater Total Estimated Fair       Value GrossUnrealizedLosses Estimated Fair      Value GrossUnrealizedLosses Estimated Fair          Value GrossUnrealizedLosses (In millions)Debt securities issued by United States government agencies$1,584 $(1) $507 $(4) $2,091 $(5)Debt securities issued by the United States Treasury1,253 — 289 (2) 1,542 (2)Corporate debt securities167 — 794 (6) 961 (6)Asset-backed securities— — 176 (2) 176 (2)Total$3,004 $(1) $1,766 $(14) $4,770 $(15)The gross unrealized losses are related to fixed income securities, temporary in nature, and driven primarily by changes in interest rates.

We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis. There were no significant transfers between Levels 1 and 2 financial assets and liabilities for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019. Level 3 financial assets and liabilities are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances. 13NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)  Fair Value at Pricing Category October 28, 2018 January 28, 2018   (In millions)Assets     Cash equivalents and marketable securities:   Corporate debt securitiesLevel 2 $2,727 $1,295Debt securities of United States government agenciesLevel 2 $2,135 $815Debt securities issued by the United States TreasuryLevel 2 $1,542 $573Money market fundsLevel 1 $602 $3,789Foreign government bondsLevel 2 $191 $41Asset-backed securitiesLevel 2 $176 $252Mortgage-backed securities issued by United States government-sponsored enterprisesLevel 2 $99 $130      Liabilities     Current liability:     1.00% Convertible Senior Notes (1)Level 2 $43 $189Other noncurrent liabilities:     2.20% Notes Due 2021 (1)Level 2 $971 $9823.20% Notes Due 2026 (1)Level 2 $943 $986(1)These liabilities are carried on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at their original issuance value, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance costs, and are not marked to fair value each period.

We designate these contracts as cash flow hedges and assess the effectiveness of the hedge relationships on a spot to spot basis. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified to operating expense when the related operating expenses are recognized in earnings or ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018.We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore, the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018: October 28, 2018 January 28, 2018 (In millions)Designated as cash flow hedges$403 $104Not designated for hedge accounting$93 $94As of October 28, 2018, all designated foreign currency forward contracts mature within eighteen months. The expected realized gains and losses deferred into accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to foreign currency forward contracts within the next twelve months was not significant.During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal years 2019 and 2018, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.Note 11 - GuaranteesU.S. GAAP requires that upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee.Accrual for Product Warranty LiabilitiesWe record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized primarily based on historical return rates. Cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties. Under limited circumstances, we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products. Additionally, we accrue for known warranty and indemnification issues if a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The estimated product returns and estimated product warranty liabilities was $18 million and $15 million as of October 28, 2018 and January 28, 2018, respectively.In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters such as tax, product, and employee liabilities. We have included intellectual property indemnification provisions in our technology related agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications. 16NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Note 12 - DebtLong-Term Debt2.20% Notes Due 2021 and 3.20% Notes Due 2026In fiscal year 2017, we issued $1.00 billion of the 2.20% Notes Due 2021, and $1.00 billion of the 3.20% Notes Due 2026, or collectively, the Notes. Interest on the Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year, beginning on March 16, 2017. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discount and issuance costs.The Notes are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.The carrying value of the Notes and the associated interest rates were as follows:  ExpectedRemaining Term (years) EffectiveInterest Rate October 28, 2018 January 28, 2018      (In millions)2.20% Notes Due 2021 2.9 2.38% $1,000 $1,0003.20% Notes Due 2026 7.9 3.31% 1,000 1,000Unamortized debt discount and issuance costs     (13) (15)Net carrying amount     $1,987 $1,985Convertible Debt1.00% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2018In fiscal year 2014, we issued $1.50 billion of 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018. The Convertible Notes will mature on December 1, 2018 and we had $3 million in principal amount outstanding as of October 28, 2018. Effective August 1, 2018, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes before the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of December 1, 2018 regardless of conversion conditions.During the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we paid cash to settle an aggregate of $11 million in principal amount of the Convertible Notes and issued 485 thousand shares of our common stock for the excess conversion value. The related loss on early conversions was not significant. Based on the closing price of our common stock of $198.29 on the last trading day of the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, the if-converted value of the remaining outstanding Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount by approximately $31 million. As of October 28, 2018, the conversion rate was 49.95 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes.Note HedgesConcurrently with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we entered into the Note Hedges. The Note Hedges have an adjusted strike price of $20.02 per share and allow us to receive shares of our common stock and/or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would deliver and/or pay, respectively, to the holders of the Convertible Notes upon conversion. Through October 28, 2018, we had received 56 million shares of our common stock from the exercise of a portion of the Note Hedges related to the settlement of $1.50 billion in principal amount of the Convertible Notes. 17NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)Revolving Credit FacilityWe have a Credit Agreement under which we may borrow up to $575 million for general corporate purposes and can obtain revolving loan commitments up to $425 million.

The USPTO instituted IPRs for four U.S. patents and declined to institute IPRs on two U.S. patents. The USPTO issued a Final Written Decision on the IPR relating to one of the patents on June 19, 2018, finding claims 1-23 and 28 unpatentable but that claims 24-27 were not proved unpatentable.On June 15, 2017, the California Court granted NVIDIA's motion to stay the district court litigation pending resolution of the petitions for IPR. The California Court has not set a trial date.On December 30, 2016, Polaris filed a complaint against NVIDIA for patent infringement in the Regional Court of Düsseldorf, Germany.

ZiiLabs is a Bermuda corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Asia Limited, a Hong Kong company which is itself is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Creative Technology Ltd., a publicly traded Singapore company. The complaint seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or direct infringement of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents. On November 27, 2017, NVIDIA answered the ZiiLabs complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the ZiiLabs 1 Patents.On January 10, 2018, ZiiLabs filed a first amended complaint asserting infringement of a fifth U.S. patent.On February 22, 2018, the Delaware Court stayed the ZiiLabs 1 case pending the resolution of the ITC investigation over the ZiiLabs 2 patents. 18NVIDIA CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIESNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)(Unaudited)ZiiLabs 2 Patents LawsuitsOn December 27, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a second complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that NVIDIA has infringed four additional U.S. patents, or the ZiiLabs 2 Patents. The second complaint also seeks unspecified monetary damages, enhanced damages, interest, costs, and fees against NVIDIA and an injunction against further direct or direct infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents.On February 22, 2018, the Delaware Court stayed the district court action on the ZiiLabs 2 patents pending the resolution of the ITC Investigation over the ZiiLabs 2 patents.On December 29, 2017, ZiiLabs filed a request with the U.S. International Trade Commission, or USITC, to commence an Investigation pursuant to Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 relating to the unlawful importation of certain graphics processors and products containing the same. ZiiLabs alleges that the unlawful importation results from the infringement of the ZiiLabs 2 Patents by products from respondents NVIDIA, ASUSTeK Computer Inc., ASUS Computer International, EVGA Corporation, Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd., G.B.T. Inc., Micro-Star International Co., Ltd., MSI Computer Corp., Nintendo Co., Ltd., Nintendo of America Inc., PNY Technologies Inc., Zotac International (MCO) Ltd., and Zotac USA Inc.On February 28, 2018, NVIDIA and the other respondents answered the ITC complaint and asserted various defenses including non-infringement and invalidity of the four asserted ZiiLabs 2 patents.On May 10, 2018, the Administrative Law Judge presiding over the investigation issued an Initial Determination terminating the investigation with respect to one of the patents.  On July 17, 2018, the USITC affirmed this decision on modified grounds.On October 18, 2018, the Administrative Law Judge currently presiding over the investigation issued an order construing certain claims of the three remaining patents in the investigation.The hearing in the investigation is currently scheduled to begin January 25, 2019.  The target date for completion of the investigation is September 9, 2019.Accounting for Loss ContingenciesWhile there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe the claims made by the other parties in the above ongoing matters are without merit and we intend to vigorously defend the actions. As of October 28, 2018, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible loss or range of loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. We are engaged in other legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of its business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.Note 14 - Shareholders' Equity Capital Return Program Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we repurchased a total of 1 million shares and 4 million shares, respectively, for $200 million and $855 million, respectively. During the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we also paid $91 million and $273 million, respectively, in cash dividends to our shareholders.In November 2018, we declared an increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share from $0.15 per share, to be paid with our next quarterly cash dividend on December 21, 2018, to all shareholders of record on November 30, 2018.Through October 28, 2018, we have repurchased an aggregate of 255 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $6.36 billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock. In November 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $7.00 billion under our share repurchase program.

Our operating segments are equivalent to our reportable segments. We report our business in two primary reportable segments - the GPU business and the Tegra Processor business - based on a single underlying architecture. While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for artificial intelligence, or AI, data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Under the single unifying architecture for our GPU and Tegra Processors, we leverage our visual computing expertise by charging the operating expenses of certain core engineering functions to the GPU business, while charging the Tegra Processor business for the incremental cost of the teams working directly for that business. In instances where the operating expenses of certain functions benefit both reportable segments, our CODM assigns 100% of those expenses to the reportable segment that benefits the most. The “All Other” category presented below represents the revenue and expenses that our CODM does not assign to either the GPU business or the Tegra Processor business for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The revenue includes primarily patent licensing revenue and the expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, product warranty charge, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature. Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Reportable segments do not record intersegment revenue, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements.

We have extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for better 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has evolved the GPU into a computer brain at the intersection of virtual reality, high performance computing, or HPC, and artificial intelligence, or AI.Our two reportable segments - GPU and Tegra Processor - are based on a single underlying architecture. From our proprietary processors, we have created platforms that address four large markets where our expertise is critical: Gaming, Professional Visualization, Datacenter, and Automotive.While our GPU and CUDA architecture is unified, our GPU product brands are aimed at specialized markets including GeForce for gamers; Quadro for designers; Tesla and DGX for AI data scientists and big data researchers; and GRID for cloud-based visual computing users. Our Tegra brand integrates an entire computer onto a single chip, and incorporates GPUs and multi-core CPUs to drive supercomputing for autonomous robots, drones, and cars, as well as for consoles and mobile gaming and entertainment devices. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998. 23Recent Developments, Future Objectives and ChallengesThird Quarter of Fiscal Year 2019 Summary Three Months Ended     October 28, 2018 July 29, 2018 October 29, 2017 Quarter-over-Quarter Change Year-over-Year Change ($ in millions, except per share data)    Revenue$3,181 $3,123 $2,636 2 % 21%Gross margin60.4% 63.3% 59.5% (290) bps 90 bpsOperating expenses$863 $818 $674 6 % 28%Income from operations$1,058 $1,157 $895 (9)% 18%Net income$1,230 $1,101 $838 12 % 47%Net income per diluted share$1.97 $1.76 $1.33 12 % 48%Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 increased 21% year over year and increased 2% sequentially. GPU business revenue was $2.77 billion, up 25% from a year earlier and up 4% sequentially, reflecting growth in professional visualization, datacenter, and gaming GPUs. Tegra Processor business revenue - which includes automotive, SOC modules for the Nintendo Switch gaming console, and other embedded edge AI platforms - was $407 million, down 3% from a year ago and down 13% sequentially.  Gaming revenue was $1.76 billion, up 13% from a year ago driven by growth in gaming GPUs, and down 2% sequentially as gaming GPU growth was more than offset by a seasonal decline in SOC modules for Nintendo Switch. Gaming GPU growth was fueled by Turing-based GPUs for desktops and by gaming notebooks based on our Max-Q technology.Professional visualization revenue was $305 million, up 28% from a year earlier and up 9% sequentially driven by strength across both desktop and mobile workstation products. Datacenter revenue was $792 million, up 58% from a year ago and up 4% sequentially, led by strong sales of our Volta architecture-based products, including NVIDIA Tesla V100 and DGX systems, with contribution from the new Turing T4 Cloud GPU. Automotive revenue of $172 million was up 19% from a year earlier and up 7% sequentially, incorporating infotainment modules, production DRIVE PX platforms, and development agreements with automotive companies.OEM and IP revenue was $148 million, down 23% from a year ago, due to the absence of cryptocurrency mining.Gross margin for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 was 60.4%. Gross margins increased from a year ago - reflecting our continued shift toward higher-value platforms, which more than offset the current quarter impact of $57 million in charges related to prior architecture components and chips following the sharp fall-off in cryptocurrency mining demand.Operating expenses for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $863 million, up 28% from a year earlier and up 6% sequentially, reflecting increased headcount and related costs for our growth initiatives - including gaming, professional visualization, AI, and autonomous driving.Income from operations for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 was $1.06 billion, up 18% from a year earlier and down 9% sequentially. Net income and net income per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 were $1.23 billion and $1.97, respectively, up 47% and 48%, respectively, from a year earlier, fueled by strong revenue growth and improved gross margin.  24We previously announced our plan to return $1.25 billion to shareholders in fiscal year 2019. During the first nine months of fiscal year 2019, we returned $1.13 billion to shareholders through a combination of $855 million in share repurchases and $273 million in cash dividends. In November 2018, our board of directors authorized an additional $7.00 billion under our share repurchase program for a total of $7.94 billion available through the end of December 2022. We announced a 7% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $0.16 per share from $0.15 per share, to be paid with our next quarterly cash dividend on December 21, 2018, to all shareholders of record on November 30, 2018. We intend to return an additional $3.00 billion to shareholders by the end of fiscal year 2020, which may begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019.Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.59 billion as of October 28, 2018, compared with $7.94 billion at the end of the prior quarter. The decrease was primarily related to third quarter stock repurchases, dividends and taxes paid related to restricted stock units, partially offset by operating income and changes in working capital.GPU BusinessDuring the third quarter of fiscal year 2019, we introduced RAPIDS, an open-source GPU-acceleration platform for data science and machine learning; launched the NVIDIA T4 cloud GPU and NVIDIA TensorRT Hyperscale Inference Platform to deliver advanced acceleration in hyperscale datacenters; launched the NVIDIA RTX Server; released the GeForce RTX series, the first gaming GPUs based on the Turing architecture; and unveiled the Quadro RTX series, which is designed to revolutionize the workflow of designers and artists on the desktop.During the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we marked the launch of the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, powered by NVIDIA Volta Tensor Core GPUs; introduced NVIDIA HGX-2, a unified computing platform for both AI and high performance computing; announced that five of the world's seven fastest supercomputers are powered by NVIDIA GPUs; introduced the NVIDIA HGX-2 platform for both AI and HPC; and launched AIRI Mini with Pure Storage and ONTAP AI with NetApp for implementing and scaling deep learning.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURESControls and ProceduresDisclosure Controls and ProceduresBased on their evaluation as of October 28, 2018, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to provide reasonable assurance.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial ReportingThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the third quarter of fiscal year 2019 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of ControlsOur management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.PART II.
