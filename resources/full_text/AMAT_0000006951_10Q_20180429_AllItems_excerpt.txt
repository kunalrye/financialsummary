Note 1 Basis of Presentation

Basis of Presentation

In the opinion of management, the unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements of Applied Materials, Inc. and its subsidiaries (Applied or the Company) included herein have been prepared on a basis consistent with the October 29, 2017 audited consolidated financial statements and include all material adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary to fairly present the information set forth therein. These unaudited interim consolidated condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Applied’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2017 (2017 Form 10-K). Applied’s results of operations for the three and six months ended April 29, 2018 are not necessarily indicative of future operating results. Applied’s fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in October of each year. Fiscal 2018 and 2017 each contain 52 weeks, and the first half of fiscal 2018 and 2017 each contained 26 weeks. 

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. On an ongoing basis, Applied evaluates its estimates, including those related to accounts receivable and sales allowances, fair values of financial instruments, inventories, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment, fair values of share-based awards, and income taxes, among others. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Accounting Standards Adopted

Inventory Measurement. In July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued authoritative guidance that requires inventory to be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value instead of at lower of cost or market. This guidance does not apply to inventory that is measured using last-in, first out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method but applies to all other inventory including those measured using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or the average cost method. Applied adopted this authoritative guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 prospectively to measurement of inventory after the effective date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.

Share-Based Compensation. In March 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including forfeitures, income tax, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Applied adopted this guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Upon adoption, Applied elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to determine the amount of compensation costs to be recognized in each period. The new standard also required recognition of excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes rather than additional paid-in capital prospectively. In the six months ended April 29, 2018, Applied recognized an excess tax benefit of $53 million in the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations. Additionally, Applied elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid for withheld shares retrospectively. Adopting this guidance increased cash provided by operating activities by a net $159 million with a corresponding net decrease in cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended April 30, 2017.

Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted

Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. In February 2018, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that allows stranded tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The authoritative guidance will be applied either in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Act is recognized. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements. 

Derivatives and Hedging. In August 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that modifies the recognition and presentation of hedge accounting to better align an entity’s risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships. The authoritative guidance expands the application of hedge accounting for non-financial and financial risk components and eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, with early adoption permitted. Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.



Retirement Benefits. In March 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires companies to present the service cost component of net benefit cost in the same line items in which they report compensation cost. The other components of net benefit cost are required to be presented in the income statement separately from the service cost component and outside a subtotal of income from operations, if one is presented. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a retrospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is only expected to result in reclassification of other components of net benefit costs outside of income from operations and is not expected to have a significant impact on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.

Goodwill Impairment. In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that simplifies the process required to test goodwill for impairment. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.

Business Combinations. In January 2017, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that clarifies the definition of a business to help companies evaluate whether acquisition or disposal transactions should be accounted for as asset groups or as businesses. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 on a prospective basis, with early adoption permitted. The impact of the adoption depends on the facts and circumstances of future acquisition or disposal transactions.


Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. In August 2016, a new authoritative guidance was issued which addresses classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments related to the statement of cash flows. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.


Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued authoritative guidance for lease accounting, which requires lessees to recognize lease assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for certain lease arrangements that are classified as operating leases under the previous standard, and to provide for enhanced disclosures. The authoritative guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and should be applied using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. Applied is currently evaluating the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s consolidated financial statements.


Revenue Recognition. In May 2014, the FASB issued authoritative guidance that requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services, and requires certain additional disclosures. This new standard will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. Entities will have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach to adopting the guidance. In August 2015, the FASB issued an amendment to defer the effective date by one year and allow entities to early adopt no earlier than the original effective date. With this amendment, the guidance will be effective for Applied in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, which is the Company’s planned adoption date. Applied currently anticipates adopting this new guidance using the full retrospective approach, although this continues to be assessed as part of the overall evaluation. 

In fiscal 2016, Applied established a project steering committee and cross-functional implementation team to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to Applied’s revenue contracts. In addition, the implementation team is also responsible for identifying and implementing changes to business processes, systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard. While the Company’s evaluation of the impact of this new guidance is not complete, Applied currently expects the timing of revenue recognition for certain products to be earlier than under current revenue recognition guidance. Applied will continue to complete its evaluation of the effect of this new guidance on Applied’s financial position, results of operations and its ongoing financial reporting, and its preliminary assessments are subject to change.

Note 2Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is determined using the weighted average number of common shares and potential common shares (representing the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock units, and employee stock purchase plan shares) outstanding during the period. Applied’s net income has not been adjusted for any period presented for purposes of computing basic or diluted earnings per share due to the Company’s non-complex capital structure.

Gains and Losses on Investments

During the three and six months ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017, gross realized gains and losses on investments were not material.


Unrealized gains and temporary losses on investments classified as available-for-sale are included within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of any related tax effect. Upon realization, those amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) to results of operations.

Note 4 Fair Value Measurements

Applied’s financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value, except for equity investments in privately-held companies. These equity investments are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when events or circumstances indicate that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. Applied’s nonfinancial assets, such as goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, are recorded at cost and are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.

Fair Value Hierarchy


•Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

•Level 2 — Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and

•Level 3 — Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Applied’s investments consist primarily of debt securities that are classified as available-for-sale and recorded at their fair values. In determining the fair value of investments, Applied uses pricing information from pricing services that value securities based on quoted market prices and models that utilize observable market inputs. In the event a fair value estimate is unavailable from a pricing service, Applied generally obtains non-binding price quotes from brokers. Applied then reviews the information provided by the pricing services or brokers to determine the fair value of its short-term and long-term investments. In addition, to validate pricing information obtained from pricing services, Applied periodically performs supplemental analysis on a sample of securities. Applied reviews any significant unanticipated differences identified through this analysis to determine the appropriate fair value.

Investments with remaining effective maturities of 12 months or less from the balance sheet date are classified as short-term investments. Investments with remaining effective maturities of more than 12 months from the balance sheet date are classified as long-term investments. As of April 29, 2018, substantially all of Applied’s available-for-sale, short-term and long-term investments were recognized at fair value that was determined based upon observable inputs.

Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements during the three and six months ended April 29, 2018 or April 30, 2017. Applied did not have any financial assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements as of April 29, 2018 or October 29, 2017.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis

Equity investments in privately-held companies are generally accounted for under the cost method of accounting and are periodically assessed for other-than-temporary impairment when an event or circumstance indicates that an other-than-temporary decline in value may have occurred. If Applied determines that an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the investment will be written down to its estimated fair value based on available information, such as pricing in recent rounds of financing, current cash positions, earnings and cash flow forecasts, recent operational performance and any other readily available market data. As of April 29, 2018, equity investments in privately-held companies totaled $80 million, of which $64 million of these investments were accounted for under the cost method of accounting and $16 million of investments had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements due to an other-than-temporary decline in value. As of October 29, 2017, equity investments in privately-held companies totaled $74 million, of which $65 million of these investments were accounted for under the cost method of accounting and $9 million of investments had been measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis within Level 3 fair value measurements due to an other-than-temporary decline in value. Impairment charges on equity investments in privately-held companies during the three and six months ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017 were not material.

Other

The carrying amounts of Applied’s financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, notes payable - short term, and accounts payable and accrued expenses, approximate fair value due to their short maturities. As of April 29, 2018 the carrying amount of long-term debt was $5.3 billion and the estimated fair value was $5.6 billion. As of October 29, 2017, the carrying amount of long-term debt was $5.3 billion and the estimated fair value was $5.8 billion. The estimated fair value of long-term debt is determined by Level 2 inputs and is based primarily on quoted market prices for the same or similar issues. See Note 9 of the Notes to the Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for further detail of existing debt.

Note 5Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

Derivative Financial Instruments

Applied conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with certain transactions denominated in local currencies, such as the Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Taiwanese dollar. Applied uses derivative financial instruments, such as forward exchange contracts and currency option contracts, to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within the next 24 months. The purpose of Applied’s foreign currency management is to mitigate the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated revenues, costs and eventual cash flows. The terms of currency instruments used for hedging purposes are generally consistent with the timing of the transactions being hedged. 

During fiscal 2017, Applied entered into and settled interest rate lock agreements, with a total notional amount of $700 million to hedge against the variability of cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate of fixed rate debt. These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges at inception and settled in conjunction with the issuance of debt in March 2017. The $14 million loss from the settlement of the interest rate lock agreement, which was included in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) in stockholders’ equity, is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior unsecured 10-year notes issued in March 2017. 

Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Derivative instruments and hedging activities, including foreign currency exchange and interest rate contracts, are recognized on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment, as well as the ineffective portion of any hedges, are recognized currently in earnings. All of Applied’s derivative financial instruments are recorded at their fair value in other current assets or in accounts payable and accrued expenses. 

Hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of the hedge as cash flow hedges and foreign exchange derivatives are typically entered into once per month. Cash flow hedges are evaluated for effectiveness quarterly. The effective portion of the gain or loss on these hedges is reported as a component of AOCI in stockholders’ equity and is reclassified into earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. The majority of the after-tax net income or loss related to foreign exchange derivative instruments included in AOCI as of April 29, 2018 is expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months. Changes in the fair value of currency forward exchange and option contracts due to changes in time value are excluded from the assessment of effectiveness. Both ineffective hedge amounts and hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings. If the transaction being hedged is no longer probable to occur, or if a portion of any derivative is deemed to be ineffective, Applied promptly recognizes the gain or loss on the associated financial instrument in earnings. The amount recognized due to discontinuance of cash flow hedges that were probable not to occur by the end of the originally specified time period was not significant for the three and six months ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017.

Additionally, forward exchange contracts are generally used to hedge certain foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. These derivatives are typically entered into once per month and are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of these hedges are recorded in earnings to offset the changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged.

The fair values of foreign exchange derivative instruments as of April 29, 2018 and October 29, 2017 were not material.

Credit Risk Contingent Features

If Applied’s credit rating were to fall below investment grade, it would be in violation of credit risk contingent provisions of the derivative instruments discussed above, and certain counterparties to the derivative instruments could request immediate payment on derivative instruments in net liability positions. The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that were in a net liability position was immaterial as of April 29, 2018.

Entering into derivative contracts with banks exposes Applied to credit-related losses in the event of the banks’ nonperformance. However, Applied’s exposure is not considered significant.

Note 6Accounts Receivable, Net 

Applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. Applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse. Applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. The discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. 

Applied sold $390 million and $766 million of accounts receivable during the three and six months ended April 29, 2018, respectively. Applied sold $86 million and $149 million of accounts receivable during the three and six months ended April 30, 2017, respectively. Applied did not discount letters of credit issued by customers or discount promissory notes during the three and six months ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017. Financing charges on the sale of receivables and discounting of letters of credit are included in interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Condensed Statements of Operations and were not material for all periods presented.

Accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $34 million as of April 29, 2018 and October 29, 2017. Applied sells its products principally to manufacturers within the semiconductor and display industries. While Applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate and represents its best estimate as of April 29, 2018, it continues to closely monitor customer liquidity and industry and economic conditions, which may result in changes to Applied’s estimates.

Note 8Goodwill, Purchased Technology and Other Intangible Assets

Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets

Applied’s methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to purchase acquisitions is determined through established and generally accepted valuation techniques. Goodwill is measured as the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the amounts assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less liabilities assumed. Applied assigns assets acquired (including goodwill) and liabilities assumed to one or more reporting units as of the date of acquisition. Typically, acquisitions relate to a single reporting unit and thus do not require the allocation of goodwill to multiple reporting units. If the products obtained in an acquisition are assigned to multiple reporting units, the goodwill is distributed to the respective reporting units as part of the purchase price allocation process.

Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant judgment, especially in emerging markets. Applied regularly monitors current business conditions and considers other factors including, but not limited to, adverse industry or economic trends, restructuring actions and lower projections of profitability that may impact future operating results.

To test goodwill for impairment, Applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, Applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, Applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. Applied determines the fair value of each of its reporting units based on a weighting of income and market approaches. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If Applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.

As of April 29, 2018, Applied’s reporting units include Semiconductor Product Group and Imaging and Process Control Group, which combine to form the Semiconductor Systems reporting segment, Applied Global Services, and Display and Adjacent Markets. 

The evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment requires the exercise of significant judgment. In the event of future changes in business conditions, Applied will be required to reassess and update its forecasts and estimates used in future impairment analyses. If the results of these future analyses are lower than current estimates, a material impairment charge may result at that time. 





APPLIED MATERIALS, INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Finite-Lived Purchased Intangible Assets

Applied amortizes purchased intangible assets with finite lives using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the assets, ranging from 1 to 15 years.

Applied evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset group may not be recoverable. Applied assesses the fair value of the assets based on the amount of the undiscounted future cash flow that the assets are expected to generate and recognizes an impairment loss when estimated undiscounted future cash flow expected to result from the use of the asset, plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset, if any, are less than the carrying value of the asset. When Applied identifies an impairment, Applied reduces the carrying value of the group of assets to comparable market values, when available and appropriate, or to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow approach.

Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. Applied evaluates the useful lives of its intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances require revising the remaining period of amortization. In addition, Applied reviews intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable. Management considers such indicators as significant differences in actual product acceptance from the estimates, changes in the competitive and economic environments, technological advances, and changes in cost structure.

Note 9Borrowing Facilities and Debt

Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in September 2021. This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of various benchmark rates selected by Applied for each advance, plus a margin based on Applied’s public debt rating and includes financial and other covenants. Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $73 million are with Japanese banks. Applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities as of both April 29, 2018 and October 29, 2017, and Applied has not utilized these credit facilities. In fiscal 2011, Applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. As of April 29, 2018, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding.

In February 2018, the Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program authorizing up to an additional $6.0 billion in repurchases. As of April 29, 2018, $6.3 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under these repurchase programs.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)

Applied records treasury stock purchases under the cost method using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Upon reissuance of treasury stock, amounts in excess of the acquisition cost are credited to additional paid in capital. If Applied reissues treasury stock at an amount below its acquisition cost and additional paid in capital associated with prior treasury stock transactions is insufficient to cover the difference between the acquisition cost and the reissue price, this difference is recorded against retained earnings. 

Dividends

In February 2018 and December 2017, Applied’s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.20 per share and $0.10 per share, respectively. Dividends paid during the six months ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017 totaled $211 million and $216 million, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applied’s stockholders. 

Share-Based Compensation

Applied has a stockholder-approved equity plan, the Employee Stock Incentive Plan, which permits grants to employees of share-based awards, including stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares and performance units. In addition, the plan provides for the automatic grant of restricted stock units to non-employee directors and permits the grant of share-based awards to non-employee directors and consultants. Share-based awards made under the plan may be subject to accelerated vesting under certain circumstances in the event of a change in control of Applied. Applied also has two Employee Stock Purchase Plans, one generally for United States employees and a second for employees of international subsidiaries (collectively, ESPP), which enable eligible employees to purchase Applied common stock. 



The cost associated with share-based awards that are subject solely to time-based vesting requirements, less expected forfeitures, is recognized over the awards’ service period for the entire award on a straight-line basis. The cost associated with performance-based equity awards is recognized for each tranche over the service period, based on an assessment of the likelihood that the applicable performance goals will be achieved.

As of April 29, 2018, Applied had $447 million in total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to grants of share-based awards and shares issued under Applied’s ESPP, which will be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.7 years. As of April 29, 2018, there were 82 million shares available for grants of share-based awards under the Employee Stock Incentive Plan, and an additional 19 million shares available for issuance under the ESPP.

Restricted Stock Units, Restricted Stock, Performance Shares and Performance Units



As of April 29, 2018, 1 million additional performance-based awards could be earned based upon achievement of certain levels of specified performance goals.

During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, certain executive officers were granted awards that are subject to the achievement of specified performance goals. These awards become eligible to vest only if performance goals are achieved and will vest only if the grantee remains employed by Applied through each applicable vesting date. Certain awards require the achievement of positive adjusted operating profit and vest ratably over three years. Other awards require the achievement of targeted levels of adjusted operating margin and wafer fabrication equipment market share, and the number of shares that may vest in full after three years ranges from 0% to 200% of the target amount. 

The fair value of these awards is estimated on the date of grant. If the goals are achieved, the awards will vest, provided that the grantee remains employed by Applied through each applicable vesting date. If the performance goals are not met as of the end of the performance period, no compensation expense is recognized and any previously recognized compensation expense is reversed. The expected cost is based on the awards that are probable to vest and is reflected over the service period and reduced for estimated forfeitures.

 Note 11 Income Taxes

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act includes a reduction to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0 percent and requires a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries payable over eight years. U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were subject to remeasurement due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate. Applied has a blended U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 23.4 percent for fiscal year 2018 based on the number of days before and after the effective date of the Tax Act. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period for companies to complete this accounting. Pursuant to this guidance, provisional adjustments were recorded when reasonable estimates could be determined. No adjustments were recorded when reasonable estimates could not be determined. These provisional estimates will be revised as information becomes available and as guidance is issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed during the measurement period, which will not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date.


The Tax Act also includes provisions that do not affect Applied in fiscal 2018, including a provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”). Due to the complexity of the GILTI tax rules, this provision and related tax accounting will continue to be evaluated. An accounting policy choice is allowed to either treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the “period cost method”) or factor such amounts into the measurement of deferred taxes (the “deferred method”). The calculation of the deferred balance with respect to the new GILTI tax provisions will depend, in part, on analyzing global income to determine whether future U.S. inclusions in taxable income are expected related to GILTI and, if so, what the impact is expected to be. An accounting policy choice has not yet been made.

Applied’s effective tax rates for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 12.8 percent and 9.3 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was higher than in the same period in the prior year primarily due to $71 million of income tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to adjustments in the transition tax and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets under the Tax Act. Applied’s effective tax rates for the first half of fiscal 2018 and 2017 were 48.6 percent and 9.1 percent, respectively. The effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2018 was higher than in the same period in the prior year primarily due to $1.1 billion of income tax expense for the transition tax and the decrease in U.S. deferred tax assets under the Tax Act. This was partially offset by the recognition of a tax benefit of $53 million related to the adoption of authoritative guidance for share-based compensation, the effect of the lower U.S. federal corporate tax rate, and changes in the geographical composition of income.

During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that existing liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits could be reduced by approximately $44 million as a result of negotiations with taxing authorities and the expiration of statutes of limitation.

Note 12Warranty, Guarantees and Contingencies 

Warranty



 Applied products are generally sold with a warranty for a 12-month period following installation. The provision for the estimated cost of warranty is recorded when revenue is recognized. Parts and labor are covered under the terms of the warranty agreement. The warranty provision is based on historical experience by product, configuration and geographic region. Quarterly warranty consumption is generally associated with sales that occurred during the preceding four quarters, and quarterly warranty provisions are generally related to the current quarter’s sales.

Guarantees

In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of April 29, 2018, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $64 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.

Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of April 29, 2018, Applied has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $150 million to cover these arrangements.

Legal Matters

From time to time, Applied receives notification from third parties, including customers and suppliers, seeking indemnification, litigation support, payment of money or other actions by Applied in connection with claims made against them. In addition, from time to time, Applied receives notification from third parties claiming that Applied may be or is infringing or misusing their intellectual property or other rights. Applied also is subject to various other legal proceedings and claims, both asserted and unasserted, that arise in the ordinary course of business. 

Although the outcome of the above-described matters, claims and proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, Applied does not believe that any will have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations.

Overview

Applied provides manufacturing equipment, services and software to the semiconductor, display, and related industries. Applied’s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor wafers and chips, liquid crystal and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays, and other electronic devices. These customers may use what they manufacture in their own end products or sell the items to other companies for use in advanced electronic components. Each of Applied’s businesses is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips, display technologies, and other electronic devices, as well as other factors, such as global economic and market conditions, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes.


Applied’s results are driven primarily by customer spending on capital equipment and services to support key technology transitions or to increase production volume in response to worldwide demand for semiconductors and displays. While certain existing technologies may be adapted to new requirements, some applications create the need for an entirely different technological approach. The timing of customer investment in manufacturing equipment is also affected by the timing of next generation production schedules, and the timing of capacity expansion to meet end market demand. In light of these conditions, Applied’s results can vary significantly year-over-year, as well as quarter-over-quarter.



Fiscal 2018 and 2017 each contains 52 weeks, and the first six months of fiscal 2018 and 2017 each contained 26 weeks.

During the first six months of fiscal 2018, healthy investment in semiconductor manufacturing equipment and services continued to be a strong driver of revenue. Overall semiconductor systems revenue increased as logic and NAND demand remained strong, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) demand increased, reflecting increasing memory requirements in smartphones and servers. Foundry customers invested in technology upgrades and new capacity to meet demand for advanced mobile chips and high-performance computing, and Applied saw continued demand for additional capacity at trailing geometries. Display equipment spending reflected continued investment in new technology and manufacturing equipment. Customers invested in a new generation of equipment for producing larger LCD TVs and continued to invest in new equipment for mobile devices.

The second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 included a one-time expense related to the enactment of recent U.S. tax legislation that reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.07 and $1.02, respectively.

Results of Operations

Net Sales



For the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year, net sales increased primarily due to increased customer investments in all segments, with majority of the increases resulting from investments in semiconductor equipment. The Semiconductor Systems segment’s relative share of total net sales continued to represent the largest contributor of net sales.



The changes in net sales in all regions in the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily reflected changes in semiconductor equipment customer mix and increased spending in display manufacturing equipment and semiconductor spares and services. The increase in net sales from customers in Korea, Japan, and Southeast Asia for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year, primarily reflected increased investments in semiconductor equipment and changes in semiconductor equipment customer mix. The increase in net sales from customers in China for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily reflected increased investments in semiconductor equipment and display manufacturing equipment. The decrease in net sales from customers in Taiwan for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily reflected decreased investments in semiconductor equipment, partially offset by increased investments in display manufacturing equipment.

Gross Margin



Gross margin in the second quarter and the first six months of fiscal 2018 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the increase in net sales and favorable product mix and materials cost savings. 

Gross margin during the three months ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017 included $21 million and $16 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively. Gross margin during the six months ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017 included $43 million and $33 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively. 

Research, Development and Engineering



Applied’s future operating results depend to a considerable extent on its ability to maintain a competitive advantage in the equipment and service products it provides. Development cycles range from 12 to 36 months depending on whether the product is an enhancement of an existing product, which typically has a shorter development cycle, or a new product, which typically has a longer development cycle. Most of Applied’s existing products resulted from internal development activities and innovations involving new technologies, materials and processes. In certain instances, Applied acquires technologies, either in existing or new product areas, to complement its existing technology capabilities and to reduce time to market. 




Marketing and Selling



Marketing and selling expenses increased in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017 primarily due to additional headcount. 

Marketing and selling expenses during the three months ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017 included $8 million and $7 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively. Marketing and selling expenses during the six months ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017 included $16 million and $14 million of share-based compensation expense, respectively. 

General and Administrative





Interest Expense and Interest and Other Income (loss), net



Interest expenses incurred were primarily associated with the senior unsecured notes issued in June 2011, September 2015 and March 2017. Interest expense in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 increased compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017 primarily due to the issuance of senior unsecured notes in March 2017. 

Interest and other income, net in the second quarter and first six months of fiscal 2018 increased compared to the same periods in fiscal 2017 primarily driven by higher interest income from investments.

Income Taxes



Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. It is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes in income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act includes a reduction to the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35.0 percent to 21.0 percent and requires a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries payable over eight years. U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities were subject to remeasurement due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate. Applied has a blended U.S. federal corporate tax rate of 23.4 percent for fiscal year 2018 based on the number of days before and after the effective date of the Tax Act. 

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period for companies to complete this accounting. Pursuant to SAB 118, provisional adjustments were recorded when reasonable estimates could be determined. These provisional estimates will be revised as information becomes available and as guidance is issued by the Internal Revenue Service. The accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed during the measurement period, which will not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date.

The effective tax rate for the second quarter was higher compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to $71 million of income tax expense in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 related to adjustments in the transition tax and the remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets under the Tax Act. The effective tax rate for the first half of fiscal 2018 was higher than in the same period in the prior year primarily due to $1.1 billion of income tax expense for the transition tax and the decrease in U.S. deferred tax assets under the Tax Act. This was partially offset by the recognition of a tax benefit of $53 million related to the adoption of authoritative guidance for share-based compensation, the effect of the lower U.S. federal corporate tax rate, and changes in the geographical composition of income.

Segment Information



The results for each reportable segment are discussed below.

Semiconductor Systems Segment

The Semiconductor Systems segment is comprised primarily of capital equipment used to fabricate semiconductor chips. Semiconductor industry spending on capital equipment is driven by demand for advanced electronic products, including smartphones and other mobile devices, servers, personal computers, automotive devices, storage, and other products, and the nature and timing of technological advances in fabrication processes, and as a result is subject to variable industry conditions. Development efforts are focused on solving customers’ key technical challenges in transistor, interconnect, patterning and packaging performance as devices scale to advanced technology nodes. 

The market for Semiconductor Systems products and technologies has been characterized by continued investment by semiconductor manufacturers. During the first six months of fiscal 2018, healthy investment in semiconductor manufacturing equipment continued to be a strong driver of revenue. Overall semiconductor systems revenue increased as logic and NAND demand remained strong and DRAM demand increased, reflecting increasing memory requirements in smartphones and servers. Foundry customers invested in technology upgrades and new capacity to meet demand for advanced mobile chips and high performance computing, and Applied saw continued demand for additional capacity at trailing geometries. 








Applied Global Services Segment

The Applied Global Services segment provides integrated solutions to optimize equipment and fab performance and productivity, including spares, upgrades, services, certain remanufactured earlier generation equipment and factory automation software for semiconductor, display and solar products. Customer demand for products and services is fulfilled through a global distribution system with trained service engineers located in close proximity to customer sites.

Demand for Applied Global Services’ service solutions are driven by Applied’s large and growing installed base of manufacturing systems, and customers’ needs to shorten ramp times, improve device performance and yield, and optimize factory output and operating costs. Industry conditions that affect Applied Global Services’ sales of spares and services are primarily characterized by increases in semiconductor manufacturers’ wafer starts and continued strong utilization rates, growth of the installed base of equipment, growing service intensity of newer tools, and the company’s ability to sell more comprehensive service agreements.



Net sales for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 increased compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to higher customer spending for spares and services. Operating income and operating margin for the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year increased due to higher net sales. In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, two customers each accounted for more than 10 percent of this segment’s total net sales.

There was no region that accounted for at least 30 percent of total net sales for the Applied Global Services segment for any of the periods presented.

Display and Adjacent Markets Segment

The Display and Adjacent Markets segment encompasses products for manufacturing liquid crystal and OLED displays, and other display technologies for TVs, personal computers, electronic tablets, smart phones, and other consumer-oriented devices, equipment upgrades and flexible coating systems. The segment is focused on expanding its presence through technologically-differentiated equipment for manufacturing large-scale LCD TVs, OLEDs, low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), metal oxide, and touch panel sectors; and development of products that provide customers with improved performance and yields. Display industry growth depends primarily on consumer demand for increasingly larger and more advanced TVs as well as larger and higher resolution displays for next generation mobile devices.

The market environment for Applied's Display and Adjacent Markets segment in the first half of fiscal 2018 was characterized by healthy demand for manufacturing equipment for mobile devices and TV manufacturing equipment, although these markets are susceptible to cyclical conditions. Uneven demand patterns in the Display and Adjacent Markets segment can cause significant fluctuations quarter-over-quarter, as well as year-over-year. 






Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources



Sources and Uses of Cash



Operating Activities

Cash from operating activities for the six months ended April 29, 2018 was $2.1 billion, which reflects net income adjusted for the effect of non-cash charges and changes in working capital components. Non-cash charges included depreciation, amortization, share-based compensation and deferred income taxes. Cash provided by operating activities increased from the first half of fiscal 2017 to the first half of fiscal 2018 primarily due to an increase in income taxes payable, partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable and lower net income. 

Applied has agreements with various financial institutions to sell accounts receivable and discount promissory notes from selected customers. Applied sells its accounts receivable without recourse. Applied, from time to time, also discounts letters of credit issued by customers through various financial institutions. The discounting of letters of credit depends on many factors, including the willingness of financial institutions to discount the letters of credit and the cost of such arrangements. Applied sold $766 million and $149 million of accounts receivable during the six months ended April 29, 2018 and April 30, 2017, respectively. Applied did not discount promissory notes or utilize programs to discount letters of credit issued by customers during the six months ended April 29, 2018 or April 30, 2017.

Applied’s working capital was $7.3 billion as of April 29, 2018 and $8.8 billion as of October 29, 2017. 

Days sales outstanding for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was 53 days, a decrease compared to day sales outstanding of 61 days for the same period in the prior year. Days sales outstanding varies due to the timing of shipments and payment terms, and the decrease was primarily due to higher accounts receivable factoring and better collection performance. 

Investing Activities

Applied generated $1.4 billion of cash from investing activities during the six months ended April 29, 2018. Proceeds from sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, totaled $1.7 billion and were partially offset by capital expenditures of $324 million during the six months ended April 29, 2018.

Applied’s investment portfolio consists principally of investment grade money market mutual funds, U.S. Treasury and agency securities, municipal bonds, corporate bonds and mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, as well as equity securities. Applied regularly monitors the credit risk in its investment portfolio and takes appropriate measures, which may include the sale of certain securities, to manage such risks prudently in accordance with its investment policies. During the six months ended April 29, 2018, Applied did not recognize any impairment of its fixed income securities. As of April 29, 2018, gross unrealized losses related to Applied’s investment portfolio were not material.

Financing Activities

Applied used $3.6 billion of cash in financing activities during the six months ended April 29, 2018, consisting primarily of repurchases of common stock of $3.3 billion, tax withholding payments for vested equity awards of $154 million and cash dividends to stockholders of $211 million.

In February 2018 and December 2017, Applied’s Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends in the amount of $0.20 per share and $0.10 per share, respectively. Applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis, although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on Applied’s financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, business conditions and other factors, as well as a determination by the Board of Directors that cash dividends are in the best interests of Applied’s stockholders. 

Applied has credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to $1.6 billion, of which $1.5 billion is comprised of a committed revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in September 2021. This agreement provides for borrowings in United States dollars at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by Applied for each advance and includes financial and other covenants with which Applied was in compliance as of April 29, 2018. Remaining credit facilities in the amount of approximately $73 million are with Japanese banks. Applied’s ability to borrow under these facilities is subject to bank approval at the time of the borrowing request, and any advances will be at rates indexed to the banks’ prime reference rate denominated in Japanese yen. No amounts were outstanding under any of these facilities as of both April 29, 2018 and October 29, 2017, and Applied has not utilized these credit facilities. 

In fiscal 2011, Applied established a short-term commercial paper program of up to $1.5 billion. As of April 29, 2018, Applied did not have any commercial paper outstanding but may issue commercial paper notes under this program from time to time in the future.

In March 2017, Applied issued senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion. Applied had senior unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $5.4 billion outstanding as of April 29, 2018. The indentures governing these notes include covenants with which Applied was in compliance as of April 29, 2018. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements for additional discussion of long-term debt. Applied may seek to refinance its existing debt and may incur additional indebtedness depending on Applied’s capital requirements and the availability of financing.

In the ordinary course of business, Applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated by either Applied or its subsidiaries. As of April 29, 2018, the maximum potential amount of future payments that Applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately $64 million. Applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee agreements beyond that required to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed. Applied does not believe, based on historical experience and information currently available, that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee agreements.

Applied also has agreements with various banks to facilitate subsidiary banking operations worldwide, including overdraft arrangements, issuance of bank guarantees, and letters of credit. As of April 29, 2018, Applied Materials, Inc. has provided parent guarantees to banks for approximately $150 million to cover these arrangements.

Others

During the six months ended April 29, 2018, Applied did not record a bad debt provision. While Applied believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts as of April 29, 2018 is adequate, it will continue to closely monitor customer liquidity and economic conditions.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted tax legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Tax Act requires a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. During the six months ended April 29, 2018, Applied recorded a $1.1 billion tax charge associated with the Tax Act, which included an estimate of a one-time transition tax and represents the tax payable over eight years, with 8 percent of the balance due in each of the first five years. The transition tax eliminated the requirement that cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by certain foreign subsidiaries be subject to U.S income taxes if repatriated for U.S. operations. Accordingly, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by all foreign subsidiaries may be repatriated for U.S. operation without being subject to U.S. income taxes.

Although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above, Applied’s management believes that cash generated from operations, together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability, will be sufficient to satisfy Applied’s liquidity requirements for the next 12 months. For further details regarding Applied’s operating, investing and financing activities, see the Consolidated Condensed Statements of Cash Flows in this report.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

The preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Applied’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements in this report describe the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies.


Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as Applied’s operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. In addition, management is periodically faced with uncertainties, the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time. These uncertainties include those discussed in Part II, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that Applied’s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and provide a meaningful presentation of Applied’s financial condition and results of operations.


Revenue Recognition


Warranty Costs

Applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized. Estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product, current and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs. Applied’s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates, material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period. As Applied’s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally, labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs. The quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs. Unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs. If actual warranty costs differ substantially from Applied’s estimates, revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Applied maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. This allowance is based on historical experience, credit evaluations, specific customer collection history and any customer-specific issues Applied has identified. Changes in circumstances, such as an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to meet its financial obligation to Applied or its payment trends, may require Applied to further adjust its estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to Applied, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out basis. The carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand. Applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand. In addition, inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products. If actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated, additional adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory may be required, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets

Applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable, and also annually reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives for impairment. Intangible assets, such as purchased technology, are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition. The value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired. If actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates, Applied may be required to record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. 

To test goodwill for impairment, Applied first performs a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If it is concluded that this is the case, Applied then performs the two-step goodwill impairment test. Otherwise, the two-step goodwill impairment test is not required. Under the two-step goodwill impairment test, Applied would in the first step compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, Applied would then perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill. If Applied determines that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, Applied would record an impairment charge equal to the difference.

Applied determines the fair value of each reporting unit based on a weighting of an income and a market approach. Applied bases the fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Under the income approach, Applied estimates the fair value based on discounted cash flow method.

The estimates used in the impairment testing are consistent with the discrete forecasts that Applied uses to manage its business, and considers any significant developments during the period. Under the discounted cash flow method, cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts are estimated using a terminal growth rate, which considers the long-term earnings growth rate specific to the reporting units. The estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using each reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital. The weighted average cost of capital measures a reporting unit’s cost of debt and equity financing weighted by the percentage of debt and equity in a reporting unit’s target capital structure. In addition, the weighted average cost of capital is derived using both known and estimated market metrics, and is adjusted to reflect both the timing and risks associated with the estimated cash flows. The tax rate used in the discounted cash flow method is the median tax rate of comparable companies and reflects Applied’s current international structure, which is consistent with the market participant perspective. Under the market approach, Applied uses the guideline company method which applies market multiples to forecasted revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Applied uses market multiples that are consistent with comparable publicly-traded companies and considers each reporting unit’s size, growth and profitability relative to its comparable companies. 

Management uses significant judgment when assessing goodwill for potential impairment, especially in emerging markets. Indicators of potential impairment include, but are not limited to, challenging economic conditions, an unfavorable industry or economic environment or other severe decline in market conditions. Such conditions could have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates used for the fair value calculation, resulting in an unexpected goodwill impairment charge, which could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Income Taxes

Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate are affected by the geographical composition of pre-tax income which includes jurisdictions with differing tax rates, conditional reduced tax rates and other income tax incentives. It is also affected by events that are not consistent from period to period, such as changes to income tax laws and the resolution of prior years’ income tax filings. Applied recognizes a current tax liability for the estimated amount of income tax payable on tax returns for the current fiscal year. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that they are not expected to be realized.

Applied recognizes tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized from such positions are estimated based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Any changes in judgment related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in Applied’s provision for income taxes in the quarter in which such change occurs. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized in Applied’s provision for income taxes.

The calculation of Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with Applied’s expectations could have an adverse material impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.

Non-GAAP Adjusted Financial Results

Management uses non-GAAP adjusted financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating and financial performance and for planning purposes, and as performance measures in its executive compensation program. Applied believes these measures enhance an overall understanding of our performance and investors’ ability to review the Company’s business from the same perspective as the Company’s management and facilitate comparisons of this period’s results with prior periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our ongoing operating performance. 

The non-GAAP adjusted financial measures presented below are adjusted to exclude the impact of certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, including certain items related to mergers and acquisitions; restructuring charges and any associated adjustments; impairments of assets, or investments; gain or loss on sale of strategic investments; tax effect of share-based compensation; certain income tax items and other discrete adjustments. Additionally, the second quarter and first half of fiscal 2018 non-GAAP results exclude estimated discrete income tax expense items associated with recent U.S. tax legislation. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are provided in the financial tables presented below. There are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because the non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, and may exclude certain items that may have a material impact upon our reported financial results. The presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Item 3:Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Applied is exposed to interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio and debt issuances. Applied’s investment portfolio includes fixed-income securities with a fair value of approximately $1.5 billion as of April 29, 2018. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase. Based on Applied’s investment portfolio as of April 29, 2018, an immediate 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately $21 million. While an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio, Applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed-income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other-than-temporary. As of April 29, 2018, the carrying amount of long-term debt issued by Applied was $5.3 billion with an estimated fair value of $5.6 billion. A hypothetical decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points would result in an increase in the fair value of Applied’s long-term debt issuances of approximately $546 million as of April 29, 2018.

Certain operations of Applied are conducted in foreign currencies, such as Japanese yen, euro, Israeli shekel and Taiwanese dollar. Applied enters into currency forward exchange and option contracts to hedge a portion of, but not all, existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions generally expected to occur within the next 24 months. Gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in income at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized. Because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on currency forward exchange and option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged, these financial instruments are not expected to subject Applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates. Applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures

Disclosure Controls and Procedures

As of the end of the period covered by this report, management of Applied conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, Applied’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that Applied’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report in ensuring that information required to be disclosed was recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by Applied in such reports is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

During the second quarter of fiscal 2018, there were no changes in the internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Applied’s internal control over financial reporting.

It should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events.

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION

Item 1. Legal Proceedings

The information set forth under “Legal Matters” in Note 12 in Notes to Consolidated Condensed Financial Statements is incorporated herein by reference.

Item 1A:Risk Factors

The risk factors set forth below include any material changes to, and supersede the description of, the risk factors disclosed in Part I, Item 1A of Applied’s 2017 Form 10-K. These factors could materially and adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition or results of operations and cause reputational harm, and should be carefully considered in evaluating the Company and its business, in addition to other information presented elsewhere in this report.

The industries that Applied serves can be volatile and difficult to predict.

As a supplier to the global semiconductor and display and related industries, Applied is subject to variable industry conditions, as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on several factors, including the nature and timing of technology inflections and advances in fabrication processes, the timing and requirements of new and emerging technologies and market drivers, production capacity relative to demand for chips and display technologies, end-user demand, customers’ capacity utilization, production volumes, access to affordable capital, consumer buying patterns and general economic conditions. Applied’s industries historically have been cyclical, and are subject to volatility and sudden changes in customer requirements for new manufacturing capacity and advanced technology. These changes can affect the timing and amounts of customer investments in technology and manufacturing equipment, and can have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, operating expenses, gross margins and net income. The amount and mix of capital equipment spending between different products and technologies can have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations.

To meet rapidly changing demand in the industries it serves, Applied must accurately forecast demand and effectively manage its resources and production capacity across its businesses, and may incur unexpected or additional costs to align its business operations. During periods of increasing demand for its products, Applied must have sufficient manufacturing capacity and inventory to meet customer demand; effectively manage its supply chain; attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees; and continue to control costs. During periods of decreasing demand, Applied must reduce costs and align its cost structure with prevailing market conditions; effectively manage its supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. If Applied does not effectively manage these challenges during periods of changing demand, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted. Even with effective allocation of resources and management of costs, during periods of decreasing demand, Applied’s gross margins and earnings may be adversely impacted.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.

Uncertain global economic and business conditions, along with uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt and fiscal concerns in various regions, pose challenges to the industries in which Applied operates. Markets for semiconductors and displays depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for electronic products. Economic uncertainty and related factors exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause certain Applied customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from purchasing for equipment or services, which may have an adverse impact on Applied’s revenues, results of operations and financial condition. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales, additional inventory or bad debt expense for Applied. Economic and industry uncertainty may similarly affect suppliers, which could impair their ability to deliver parts and negatively affect Applied’s ability to manage operations and deliver its products. These conditions may also lead to consolidation or strategic alliances among other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect Applied’s ability to compete effectively.

Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Applied to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Applied does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Applied may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, which may adversely affect Applied’s ability to capitalize on opportunities. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Applied must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.

Applied maintains an investment portfolio that is subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. The risks to Applied’s investment portfolio may be exacerbated if financial market conditions deteriorate and, as a result, the value and liquidity of the investment portfolio, as well as returns on pension assets, could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges. Applied also maintains cash balances in various bank accounts globally in order to fund normal operations. If any of these financial institutions becomes insolvent, it could limit Applied’s ability to access cash in the affected accounts, which could affect its ability to manage its operations.

Applied is exposed to the risks of operating a global business.

•political instability, natural disasters, pandemics, social unrest, terrorism or acts of war in locations where Applied has operations, suppliers or sales, or that may influence the value chain of the industries that Applied serves;

•challenges in hiring and integration of an increasing number of workers in new countries;

•the increasing need for a mobile workforce to work in or travel to different regions; and

•uncertainties with respect to economic growth rates in various countries, including for the manufacture and sale of semiconductors and displays in the developing economies of certain countries.

Increases in tariffs, additional taxes or trade barriers may increase our manufacturing costs, decrease margins, reduce the competitiveness of our products, or inhibit our ability to sell products or purchase necessary equipment and supplies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, government authorities may impose conditions that require the use of local suppliers or partnerships with local companies, require the license or other transfer of intellectual property, or engage in other efforts to promote local businesses and local competitors, which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business. Many of these challenges are present in China and Korea, markets that represent significant long-term growth opportunities for Applied businesses.

Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes in the various industries in which it operates.


•the nature, timing and degree of visibility of changes in end demand for electronic products, including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products, and the effects of these changes on customers’ businesses and on demand for Applied’s products;

•increasing capital requirements for building and operating new fabrication plants and customers’ ability to raise the necessary capital;

•trade, regulatory or tax policies impacting the timing of customers’ investment in new or expanded fabrication plants;

•the importance of increasing market positions in segments with growing demand;

•semiconductor manufacturer’s ability to reconfigure and re-use equipment, and the resulting effect on their need to purchase new equipment and services;

•shorter cycle times between order placements by customers and product shipment require greater reliance on forecasting of customer investment, which may lead to inventory write-offs and manufacturing inefficiencies that decrease gross margin;

•competitive factors that make it difficult to enhance position, including challenges in securing development-tool-of-record (DTOR) and production-tool-of-record (PTOR) positions with customers;

•consolidation in the semiconductor industry, including among semiconductor manufacturers and among manufacturing equipment suppliers;

•shifts in sourcing strategies by computer and electronics companies that impact the equipment requirements of Applied’s foundry customers;

•the concentration of new wafer starts in Korea and Taiwan, where Applied’s service penetration and service-revenue-per-wafer-start have been lower than in other regions; 

•investment in semiconductor manufacturing capabilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China; and

•the increasing fragmentation of semiconductor markets, leading certain markets to become too small to support the cost of a new fabrication plant, while others require less technologically advanced products.

If Applied does not accurately forecast, and allocate appropriate resources and investment towards addressing, key technology changes and inflections, successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new technologies, and effectively address industry trends, its business and results of operations may be adversely impacted.

Applied is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the display industry.


•the importance of new types of display technologies, such as organic light-emitting diode (OLED), low temperature polysilicon (LTPS), flexible displays and metal oxide, and new touch panel films;

•the increasing cost of research and development, and complexity of technology transitions and inflections, and Applied’s ability to timely and effectively anticipate and adapt to these changes;

•the timing and extent of an expansion of manufacturing facilities in China, which may be affected by changes in economic conditions and governmental policies in China;

•the importance of increasing market positions in products and technologies with growing demand;

•the rate of transition to larger substrate sizes for TVs and to new display technologies for TVs and mobile applications, and the resulting effect on capital intensity in the industry and on Applied’s product differentiation, gross margin and return on investment; and

•the variability in demand for display manufacturing equipment, concentration of display manufacturer customers and their ability to successfully commercialize new products and technologies, and uncertainty with respect to future display technology end-use applications and growth drivers.

If Applied does not successfully develop and commercialize products to meet demand for new and emerging display technologies, or if industry demand for display manufacturing equipment and technologies slows, Applied’s business and its results of operations may be adversely impacted.

The industries in which Applied operates are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological and market changes.


•identify and address technology inflections, market changes, new applications, customer requirements and end-use demand;

•develop new products and disruptive technologies, improve and develop new applications for existing products, and adapt products for use by customers in different applications and markets with varying technical requirements;

•differentiate its products from those of competitors, meet customers’ performance specifications, appropriately price products, and achieve market acceptance;

•maintain operating flexibility to enable responses to changing markets, applications, customers and customer requirements;

•enhance its worldwide operations across its businesses to reduce cycle time, enable continuous quality improvement, reduce costs, and enhance design for manufacturability and serviceability;

•focus on product development and sales and marketing strategies that address customers’ high value problems and strengthen customer relationships;

•effectively allocate resources between its existing products and markets, the development of new products, and expanding into new and adjacent markets;


•accurately forecast demand, work with suppliers and meet production schedules for its products;

•improve its manufacturing processes and achieve cost efficiencies across product offerings;

•adapt to changes in value offered by companies in different parts of the supply chain;

•qualify products for evaluation and volume manufacturing with its customers; and 

•implement changes in its design engineering methodology to reduce material costs and cycle time, increase commonality of platforms and types of parts used in different systems, and improve product life cycle management.

If Applied does not successfully anticipate technology inflections, develop and commercialize new products and technologies, and respond to changes in customer requirements and market trends, its business performance and results of operations may be adversely impacted.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with a highly concentrated customer base.

Applied’s customer base is highly concentrated, and has become increasingly concentrated as a result of continued consolidation. Applied’s customer base is also geographically concentrated. A relatively limited number of manufacturers account for a substantial portion of Applied’s business. As a result, the actions of even a single customer can expose Applied’s business and results of operations to greater volatility. The mix and type of customers, and sales to any single customer, including as a result of changes in government policy, may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year, and have a significant impact on Applied’s net sales, gross margins and net income. Applied’s products are configured to customer specifications, and changing, rescheduling or canceling orders may result in significant, non-recoverable costs. If customers do not place orders, or they substantially reduce, delay or cancel orders, Applied may not be able to replace the business, which may have a significant adverse impact on its results of operations and financial condition. The concentration of Applied’s customer base increases its risks related to the financial condition of its customers, and the deterioration in financial condition of a single customer or the failure of a single customer to perform its obligations could have a material adverse effect on Applied’s results of operations and cash flow. To the extent its customers experience liquidity constraints, Applied may incur additional bad debt expense, which may have a significant impact on its results of operations. Major customers may also seek pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to Applied, which may have a negative impact on Applied’s business, revenue and gross margins. 

Applied is exposed to risks associated with business combinations, acquisitions and strategic investments.


•diversion of management’s attention and disruption of ongoing businesses;

•contractual restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s business during the pendency of a proposed transaction;

•inability to complete proposed transactions due to the failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals, litigation or other disputes, and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee;

•the failure to realize expected returns from acquired businesses;

•requirements imposed by government regulators in connection with their review of a transaction, which may include, among other things, divestitures and restrictions on the conduct of Applied’s existing business or the acquired business;

•ineffective integration of operations, systems, technologies, products or employees, which can impact the ability to realize anticipated synergies or other benefits;

•failure to commercialize technologies from acquired businesses or developed through strategic investments;

•dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners;

•inability to capitalize on characteristics of new markets that may be significantly different from Applied’s existing markets and where competitors may have stronger market positions and customer relationships;

•failure to retain and motivate key employees of acquired businesses;

•the potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;

•potential changes in Applied’s credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company’s access to and cost of capital;

•reductions in cash balances or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes, including share repurchases and dividends;

•exposure to new operational risks, rules, regulations, worker expectations, customs and practices to the extent acquired businesses are located in regions where Applied has not historically conducted business;

•challenges associated with managing new, more diverse and more widespread operations, projects and people;

•inability to obtain and protect intellectual property rights in key technologies;

•inadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company’s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, privacy policies and procedures, or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices;

•impairment of acquired intangible assets and goodwill as a result of changing business conditions, technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the segment;

•the risk of litigation or claims associated with a proposed or completed transaction;

•unknown, underestimated or undisclosed commitments or liabilities; and

•the inappropriate scale of acquired entities’ critical resources or facilities for business needs.

Applied also makes strategic investments in other companies, including companies formed as joint ventures, which may decline in value or not meet desired objectives. The success of these investments depends on various factors over which Applied may have limited or no control and, particularly with respect to joint ventures, requires ongoing and effective cooperation with strategic partners. The risks to Applied’s strategic investment portfolio may be exacerbated by unfavorable financial market and macroeconomic conditions and, as a result, the value of the investment portfolio could be negatively impacted and lead to impairment charges.

Applied’s indebtedness and debt covenants could adversely affect its financial condition and business.

Applied has $5.4 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes outstanding. Under the indenture governing the senior unsecured notes, it may be required to offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, upon a change of control of Applied and a contemporaneous downgrade of the notes below investment grade. Applied also has in place a $1.5 billion committed revolving credit agreement. While no amounts were outstanding under this credit agreement as of April 29, 2018, Applied may borrow amounts in the future under the agreement. Applied may also enter into new financing arrangements. Applied’s ability to satisfy its debt obligations is dependent upon the results of its business operations and subject to other risks discussed in this section. Significant changes in Applied’s credit rating or changes in the interest rate environment could have a material adverse consequence on Applied’s access to and cost of capital for future financings, and financial condition. If Applied fails to satisfy its debt obligations, or comply with financial and other debt covenants, it may be in default and any borrowings may become immediately due and payable, and such default may also constitute a default under other of Applied’s obligations. There can be no assurance that Applied would have sufficient financial resources or be able to arrange financing to repay any borrowings at such time. 

Applied is exposed to risks associated with expanding into new and related markets and industries.


•the need to devote additional resources to develop new products for, and operate in, new markets;

•the need to develop new sales and technical marketing strategies, cultivate relationships with new customers and meet different customer service requirements;

•differing rates of profitability and growth among multiple businesses;

•Applied’s ability to anticipate demand, capitalize on opportunities, and avoid or minimize risks;

•the complexity of managing multiple businesses with variations in production planning, execution, supply chain management and logistics;

•the adoption of new business models, business processes and systems;

•the complexity of entering into and effectively managing strategic alliances or partnering opportunities;

•new materials, processes and technologies;

•the need to attract, motivate and retain employees with skills and expertise in these new areas;

•new and more diverse customers and suppliers, including some with limited operating histories, uncertain or limited funding, evolving business models or locations in regions where Applied does not have, or has limited, operations;

•new or different competitors with potentially more financial or other resources, industry experience and established customer relationships;

•entry into new industries and countries, with differing levels of government involvement, laws and regulations, and business, employment and safety practices;

•third parties’ intellectual property rights; and

•the need to comply with, or work to establish, industry standards and practices.


Manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect Applied’s ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory.


•the failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;

•volatility in the availability and cost of materials;

•difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;

•shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;

•information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third party supplier or service provider; and

•natural disasters or other events beyond Applied’s control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where it conducts manufacturing.


The ability to attract, retain and motivate key employees is vital to Applied’s success.


Applied is exposed to various risks related to protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights.

Applied’s success depends in significant part on the protection of its patents, trade secrets, copyrights and other intellectual property rights. Infringement of Applied’s rights by a third party, such as the unauthorized manufacture or sale of equipment or spare parts, could result in uncompensated lost market and revenue opportunities for Applied. Policing any unauthorized use of intellectual property is difficult and costly and Applied cannot be certain that the measures it has implemented will prevent misuse. Applied’s ability to enforce its intellectual property rights is subject to litigation risks, as well as uncertainty as to the protection and enforceability of those rights in some countries. If Applied seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights, it may be subject to claims that those rights are invalid or unenforceable, and others may seek counterclaims against Applied, which could have a negative impact on its business. If Applied is unable to enforce and protect intellectual property rights, or if they are circumvented, invalidated, rendered obsolete by the rapid pace of technological change, it could have an adverse impact on its competitive position and business. In addition, changes in intellectual property laws or their interpretation, such as recent changes in U.S. patent laws, may impact Applied’s ability to protect and assert its intellectual property rights, increase costs and uncertainties in the prosecution of patent applications and enforcement or defense of issued patents, and diminish the value of Applied’s intellectual property.

Third parties may also assert claims against Applied and its products. Claims that Applied’s products infringe the rights of others, whether or not meritorious, can be expensive and time-consuming to defend and resolve, and may divert the efforts and attention of management and personnel. The inability to obtain rights to use third party intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms could have an adverse impact on Applied’s business. In addition, Applied may face claims based on the theft or unauthorized use or disclosure of third-party trade secrets and other confidential business information. Any such incidents and claims could severely harm Applied’s business and reputation, result in significant expenses, harm its competitive position, and prevent Applied from selling certain products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on Applied’s business and results of operations.

Applied is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity threats and incidents.

In the conduct of its business, Applied collects, uses, transmits and stores data on information technology systems, including systems owned and maintained by Applied or third party providers. These data include confidential information and intellectual property belonging to Applied or its customers or other business partners, as well as personally-identifiable information of individuals. All information systems are subject to disruption, breach or failure. Applied has experienced, and expects to continue to be subject to, cybersecurity threats and incidents ranging from employee error or misuse to individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to these information systems, to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, none of which have been material to the Company to date. Applied devotes significant resources to network security, data encryption and other measures to protect its systems and data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, depending on their nature and scope, cybersecurity incidents could result in business disruption; the misappropriation of intellectual property, and corruption or loss of confidential information and critical data (Applied’s and that of third parties); reputational damage; litigation with third parties; diminution in the value of Applied’s investment in research, development and engineering; data privacy issues; and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs. Compliance with, and changes to, laws and regulations concerning privacy and information security could result in significant expense, and any failure to comply could result in proceedings against Applied by regulatory authorities or other third parties.

Applied is exposed to various risks related to legal proceedings.

Applied from time to time is, and in the future may be involved in legal proceedings or claims regarding patent infringement, intellectual property rights, antitrust, environmental regulations, securities, contracts, product performance, product liability, unfair competition, misappropriation of trade secrets, employment, workplace safety, and other matters. Applied also on occasion receives notification from customers who believe that Applied owes them indemnification or other obligations related to claims made against such customers by third parties.

Legal proceedings and claims, whether with or without merit, and associated internal investigations, may be time-consuming and expensive to prosecute, defend or conduct; divert management’s attention and other Applied resources; inhibit Applied’s ability to sell its products; result in adverse judgments for damages, injunctive relief, penalties and fines; and negatively affect Applied’s business. There can be no assurance regarding the outcome of current or future legal proceedings, claims or investigations.

The failure to successfully implement enterprise resource planning and other information systems changes could adversely impact Applied’s business and results of operations.

Applied is in the process of implementing new enterprise resource planning and related information systems in order to better manage its business operations, align its global organizations and enable future growth. This implementation requires the commitment of significant personnel and financial resources, and entails risks to Applied’s business operations. If Applied does not successfully implement new enterprise resource planning and related information systems, or if there are delays or difficulties in implementing these systems, Applied may not realize anticipated productivity improvements or cost efficiencies, and may experience interruptions in service and operational difficulties, such as its ability to track orders, timely manufacture and ship products, project inventory requirements, effectively manage its supply chain and allocate human resources, aggregate financial data and report operating results, and otherwise effectively manage its business, all of which could result in quality issues, reputational harm, lost market and revenue opportunities, and otherwise adversely affect Applied’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

Applied may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.

Applied has a significant amount of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of Applied’s reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of Applied common stock, changes in Applied’s strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Applied’s valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. Applied may be required to record future charges to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets is determined to exist.

Applied is exposed to risks associated with operating in jurisdictions with complex and changing tax laws.

Applied is subject to income taxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities. Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including changes in applicable tax laws, interpretations of applicable tax laws, amount and composition of pre-tax income in jurisdictions with differing tax rates, and valuation of deferred tax assets. An increase in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rate could have a material adverse impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.

On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted tax legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance on accounting for income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period for companies to complete this accounting. Pursuant to SAB 118, provisional adjustments were recorded when reasonable estimates could be determined. No adjustments were recorded when reasonable estimates could not be determined. These provisional estimates will be revised as information becomes available and guidance is issued by the Internal Revenue Service, and changes in Applied’s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates could have a material impact on Applied’s results of operations and financial condition.

Consistent with the international nature of its business, Applied conducts certain manufacturing, supply chain, and other operations in Asia, bringing these activities closer to customers and reducing operating costs. In certain foreign jurisdictions, conditional reduced income tax rates have been granted to Applied. To obtain the benefit of these tax incentives, Applied must meet requirements relating to various activities. Applied’s ability to realize benefits from these incentives could be materially affected if, among other things, applicable requirements are not met or Applied incurs net losses in these jurisdictions.

In addition, Applied is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, and from time to time amends previously filed tax returns. Applied regularly assesses the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and amendments to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes, which requires estimates and judgments. Although Applied believes its tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the tax authorities will agree with such estimates. Applied may have to engage in litigation to achieve the results reflected in the estimates, which may be time-consuming and expensive. There can be no assurance that Applied will be successful or that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in Applied’s historical income tax provisions and effective tax rates.

Applied is subject to risks associated with environmental and safety regulations.


Applied is exposed to various risks related to the global regulatory environment.

As a public company with global operations, Applied is subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions, including those related to financial and other disclosures, corporate governance, intellectual property, tax, trade, antitrust, employment, immigration and travel regulations, privacy, and anti-corruption. Changing, inconsistent or conflicting laws, rules and regulations, and ambiguities in their interpretation and application create uncertainty and challenges, and compliance with laws, rules and regulations may be onerous and expensive, divert management time and attention from revenue-generating activities, and otherwise adversely impact Applied’s business operations. Violations of law, rules and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions, restrictions on Applied’s business, and damage to its reputation, and could have an adverse impact on its business operations, financial condition and results of operations.
