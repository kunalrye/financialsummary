The fair value of customer relationships was estimated primarily based on the value of the discounted cash flows that the related intangible asset could be expected to generate in the future.
The fair value of customer relationships was estimated based on the value of the discounted cash flows that the related intangible asset could be expected to generate in the future.
The preliminary fair value of other liabilities was based on the difference in discounted cash flows related to remaining performance obligations under a certain acquired contract as compared to current market terms for similar arrangements that a market participant would expect.
Other liabilities will be credited against cost of sales over the remaining performance of the contract, which was 5.25 years as of the acquisition date.
The allocation of the preliminary purchase price shown in the above table was based on a valuation and estimates and assumptions that are subject to change within the purchase price allocation period (generally one year from the acquisition date).
The purchase agreement also provides an earn-out up to an additional $10,000,000 payable, at our election, in cash and or shares of Comtech common stock, if certain agreed upon sales milestones are reached in the twelve-month period following completion of the acquisition.
Since certain contracts extend over a long period of time, the impact of revisions in revenue and or cost estimates during the progress of work may impact current period earnings through a cumulative adjustment.
The cost-to-cost method is principally used to account for contracts in our mission-critical technologies and high-performance transmission technologies product lines and, to a lesser extent, certain location-based and messaging infrastructure contracts in our public safety and location technologies product line.
These services are typically recognized as a series of services performed over the contract term using the straight-line method, or based on our customers’ actual usage of the networks and platforms which we provide.
The contracts related to these product lines do not meet the requirements for over time revenue recognition because our customers cannot utilize the equipment for its intended purpose during any phase of our manufacturing process; customers do not simultaneously receive and or consume the benefits provided by our performance; customers do not control the asset (i.e., prior to delivery, customers cannot direct the use of the asset, sell or exchange the equipment, etc.); and, although many of our contracts have termination for convenience clauses and or an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, our performance creates an asset with an alternative use through the point of delivery.
If the standalone selling price is not observable through past transactions, we estimate the standalone selling price taking into account available information such as market conditions, including geographic or regional specific factors, competitive positioning, internal costs, profit objectives and internally approved pricing guidelines related to the performance obligations.
Of the contract liability balance at July 31, 2019 and August 1, 2018, $18,609,000 and $23,127,000 was recognized as revenue during the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
As commissions payable to our internal sales and marketing employees or contractors are contingent upon multiple factors, such commissions are not considered direct costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and are expensed as incurred in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Therefore, such commissions are included in total estimated costs at completion for such contracts and expensed over time through cost of sales on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Unbilled receivables as of October 31, 2019 relate to contracts-in-progress for which revenue has been recognized, but for which we have not yet earned the right to bill the customer for work performed to date.
As of October 31, 2019 and July 31, 2019, the amount of inventory directly related to long-term contracts (including contracts-in-progress) was $4,661,000 and $4,053,000, respectively, and the amount of inventory related to contracts from third-party commercial customers who outsource their manufacturing to us was $1,395,000 and $1,513,000, respectively.
On August 1, 2018, in connection with our adoption of ASC 606, $1,679,000 of accrued warranty obligations presented in the above table were reclassified to contract liabilities, as they represented deferred revenue related to service-type warranty performance obligations.
In doing so, during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we recorded $1,373,000 of facility exit costs in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
In connection with this ongoing evaluation and repositioning, during the three months ended October 31, 2019, we recorded $230,000 of estimated contract settlement costs in our Commercial Solutions segment.
In connection with the establishment of our new Credit Facility, during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we wrote-off $3,217,000 of deferred financing costs primarily related to the Term Loan Facility portion of our Prior Credit Facility and capitalized deferred financing costs of $1,813,000 related to the new Credit Facility.
At October 31, 2019, we had $2,632,000 of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts and no outstanding commercial letters of credit.
Stock-based compensation for equity-classified awards is measured at the date of grant, based on an estimate of the fair value of the award and is generally expensed over the vesting period of the award.
At October 31, 2019, unrecognized stock-based compensation of $11,885,000, net of estimated forfeitures of $1,085,000, is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.3 years.
Stock options outstanding as of October 31, 2019 have exercise prices ranging from $20.90 - $33.94, representing the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, a contractual term of five or ten years and a vesting period of three or five years.
As a result, 4,764 and 9,345 shares of our common stock were issued during the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, net of shares retained to satisfy the exercise price and minimum statutory tax withholding requirements.
As of October 31, 2019, the number of outstanding performance shares included in the above table, and the related compensation expense prior to consideration of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, assume achievement of the pre-established goals at a target level.
RSUs and restricted stock granted to non-employee directors prior to July 31, 2019 have a vesting period of three years and are convertible into shares of our common stock generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
Share units granted prior to July 31, 2017 were vested when issued and are convertible into shares of our common stock, generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
The fair value of performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units is determined using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the present value of any estimated future dividend equivalents such awards are not entitled to receive and an applicable estimated discount for any post vesting transfer restrictions.
With respect to the actual settlement of stock-based awards for income tax reporting, during the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded income tax benefits of $612,000 and $457,000, respectively, which primarily represent the net excess income tax benefits upon settlement of stock-based awards during each of the respective periods.
Our Government Solutions segment provides mission-critical technologies (such as tactical satellite-based networks and ongoing support for complicated communications networks) and high-performance transmission technologies (such as troposcatter systems and solid-state, high-power amplifiers) to large government end-users (including those of foreign countries), large international customers and domestic prime contractors.
In addition, during the three months ended October 31, 2018, we recorded a $3,217,000 loss from the write-off of deferred financing costs primarily related to the Term Loan Facility portion of our Prior Credit Facility.
As discussed further in Note (2) -"Acquisitions," the goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of Solacom and the GD NG-911 business was based upon valuation and estimates and assumptions that are subject to change within the purchase price allocation period (generally one year from the acquisition date).
Finally, we compared our estimates of fair values to our August 1, 2019 total public market capitalization and assessed implied control premiums based on our common stock price of $29.54 as of August 1, 2019.

The contracts related to these product lines do not meet the requirements for over time revenue recognition because our customers cannot utilize the equipment for its intended purpose during any phase of our manufacturing process; customers do not simultaneously receive and or consume the benefits provided by our performance; customers do not control the asset (i.e., prior to delivery, customers cannot direct the use of the asset, sell or exchange the equipment, etc.); and, although many of our contracts have termination for convenience clauses and or an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to date, our performance creates an asset with an alternative use through the point of delivery.
Transaction prices for contracts with U.S. domestic and international customers are usually based on specific negotiations with each customer and in the case of the U.S. government, sometimes based on estimated or actual costs of providing the goods or services in accordance with applicable regulations.
As commissions payable to our internal sales and marketing employees or contractors are contingent upon multiple factors, such commissions are not considered direct costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and are expensed as incurred in selling, general and administrative expenses on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Therefore, such types of commissions are included in total estimated costs at completion for such contracts and expensed over time through cost of sales on our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations.
Based on anticipated product mix and timing assumptions, we expect our second quarter consolidated net sales to range from $168.0 million to $170.0 million, with Adjusted EBITDA ranging from $19.0 million to approximately $21.0 million.
Consolidated net sales were $170.3 million and $160.8 million for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing an increase of $9.5 million, or 5.9%.
Net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment were $94.3 million for the three months ended October 31, 2019, as compared to $78.0 million for the three months ended October 31, 2018, a significant increase of $16.3 million, or 20.9%.
Our Commercial Solutions segment represented 55.4% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2019 as compared to 48.5% for the three months ended October 31, 2018.
Net sales in the three months ended October 31, 2019 of our public safety and location technology solutions were significantly higher as compared to the net sales we achieved in the three months ended October 31, 2018.
Net sales in our Government Solutions segment were $76.0 million for the three months ended October 31, 2019 as compared to $82.9 million for the three months ended October 31, 2018, a decrease of $6.9 million, or 8.3%.
Our Government Solutions segment represented 44.6% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2019, as compared to 51.5% for the three months ended October 31, 2018.
Net sales of our mission-critical technologies during the three months ended October 31, 2019 were significantly lower as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2018, due primarily to deliveries of our next generation MT-2025 mobile satellite transceivers in the comparable period of the prior fiscal year.
Net sales of our high-performance transmission technologies during the three months ended October 31, 2019 were higher than the three months ended October 31, 2018, driven by increased sales of our solid-state, high-power amplifiers and related switching technologies, as well as increased sales of our troposcatter technologies (including our Modular Transportable Transmission System ("MTTS") troposcatter terminals to an Asia Pacific military service).
Except for the U.S. government, there were no customers that represented more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales during the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018.
International sales for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018 (which include sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to international customers) were $39.4 million and $39.3 million, respectively.
Except for the U.S., no individual country (including sales to U.S. domestic companies for inclusion in products that are sold to a foreign country) represented more than 10.0% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018.
The increase of $5.8 million reflects significantly higher net sales in our Commercial Solutions segment, offset in part by a decrease in sales in our Government Solutions segment, as discussed above.
Gross profit, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2019 was 37.3% as compared to 35.9% for the three months ended October 31, 2018.
Our Government Solutions segment's gross profit, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for the three months ended October 31, 2019 increased slightly in comparison to the three months ended October 31, 2018.
Based on the mix and anticipated timing of shipments and performance related to orders currently in our backlog and the mix and timing of expected new orders and related net sales, gross profit for this segment, as a percentage of related segment net sales, for fiscal 2020 is expected to be similar or slightly lower than the level achieved in fiscal 2019.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, selling, general and administrative expenses were 18.7% and 19.8% for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we incurred $1.4 million of facility exit costs in our Government Solutions segment.
Excluding such costs, our selling, general and administrative expenses would have been $30.4 million, or 18.9% of consolidated net sales for the three months ended October 31, 2018.
Amortization of stock-based compensation expense recorded as selling, general and administrative expenses was $0.7 million in the three months ended October 31, 2019 as compared to $0.9 million in the three months ended October 31, 2018.
As a percentage of consolidated net sales, research and development expenses were 8.7% and 8.2% for the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
For the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, research and development expenses of $12.9 million and $11.4 million, respectively, related to our Commercial Solutions segment, and $1.9 million and $1.7 million, respectively, related to our Government Solutions segment.
The remaining research and development expenses of $0.1 million for both the three months ended October 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to the amortization of stock-based compensation expense.
Based on our current spending plans, we expect fiscal 2020 research and development expenses, in dollars, to be higher and, as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to be slightly lower than the 8.4% achieved in fiscal 2019.
During the three months ended October 31, 2019, we incurred acquisition plan expenses of $2.4 million, including expenses related to our pending acquisition of UHP, as discussed above.
During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we incurred acquisition plan expenses of $1.1 million, which primarily related to our fiscal 2019 acquisition of Solacom.
The increase in our Commercial Solutions segment’s operating income for the three months ended October 31, 2019, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was due primarily to the significant increase in this segment’s net sales offset, in part, by a slight decrease in this segment’s gross profit percentage, higher research and development expenses and increased amortization of intangibles, as discussed above.
Looking forward, given expected sales and product mix assumptions, as discussed above, we expect fiscal 2020 operating income, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be higher than the 10.1% achieved in fiscal 2019.
The increase in our Government Solutions segment’s operating income for the three months ended October 31, 2019, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was due primarily to the $1.4 million of facility exit costs that we incurred during the three months ended October 31, 2018, as discussed above.
Excluding such facility exit costs, operating income in our Government Solutions segment for the three months ended October 31, 2018 would have been $8.0 million, or 9.7% of related segment sales.
The decrease, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, in the three months ended October 31, 2019 was due primarily to the decrease in net sales, as discussed above.
Looking forward, given expected sales and product mix assumptions, as discussed above, we expect fiscal 2020 operating income, in dollars, to be comparable to the amount achieved in fiscal 2019, and as a percentage of related segment net sales, to be slightly lower than the 9.2% achieved in fiscal 2019.
The increase in unallocated expenses for the three months ended October 31, 2019 as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2018 is primarily due to increased business and sales activity, as well as higher acquisition plan expenses during the most recent fiscal quarter, as discussed above.
Excluding the $2.4 million of acquisition plan expenses and $0.2 million of estimated contract settlement costs, consolidated operating income for the three months ended October 31, 2019 would have been $11.9 million, or 7.0% of consolidated net sales.
Excluding the $1.1 million of acquisition plan expenses and $1.4 million of facility exit costs in the three months ended October 31, 2018, consolidated operating income would have been $9.8 million, or 6.1% of consolidated net sales.
Despite the incurrence of $2.4 million of acquisition plan expenses and $0.2 million of estimated contract settlement costs in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 as well as an additional $2.4 million of such costs expected during the second quarter of fiscal 2020, our fiscal 2020 GAAP consolidated operating income (in dollars) is anticipated to be higher than the $41.4 million we achieved in fiscal 2019, and as a percentage of consolidated net sales, to approximate 7.0% as compared to the 6.2% we achieved in fiscal 2019.
In connection with the establishment of our new Credit Facility in the three months ended October 31, 2018, we wrote-off $3.2 million of deferred financing costs which primarily related to the term loan portion of our Prior Credit Facility.
During the three months ended October 31, 2019, we recorded a net discrete tax benefit of $0.6 million, primarily related to discrete tax benefits for stock-based awards that were settled during the quarter.
During the three months ended October 31, 2018, we recorded a net discrete tax benefit of $2.4 million, primarily related to (i) the favorable resolution of the IRS audit of our fiscal 2016 federal income tax return, and (ii) discrete tax benefits for stock-based awards that were settled during the quarter.
The increase in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA, both in dollars and as a percentage of consolidated net sales, during the three months ended October 31, 2019 as compared to the three months ended October 31, 2018 is primarily attributable to higher consolidated net sales and operating income, as discussed above.
The increase in our Commercial Solutions segment's Adjusted EBITDA, both in dollars and as a percentage of related segment net sales, was primarily driven by significantly higher net sales, as discussed above.
Our Adjusted EBITDA is a Non-GAAP measure that represents earnings (loss) before income taxes, interest (income) and other, write-off of deferred financing costs, interest expense, amortization of stock-based compensation, amortization of intangibles, depreciation expense, estimated contract settlement costs, settlement of intellectual property litigation, acquisition plan expenses, facility exit costs and strategic alternatives analysis expenses and other.
At October 31, 2019, we had $2.6 million of standby letters of credit outstanding under our Credit Facility related to our guarantees of future performance on certain customer contracts and no outstanding commercial letters of credit.
