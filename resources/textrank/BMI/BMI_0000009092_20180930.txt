The Company maintains a non-contributory defined benefit pension plan that covers substantially all U.S. employees who were employed at December 31, 2011.
In connection with the Company's activities to terminate the plan, lump-sum distributions were made in the second quarter of 2018 to individuals who elected lump sum distributions, including rolling over their accounts or transferring them to a qualified Company plan.
As a result, the Company recorded pre-tax settlement charges of $8.2 million and $11.7 million during the second and third quarters of 2018, respectively.
The Company also disclosed in its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 that it estimated it would pay $0.4 million in other postretirement benefits in 2018 based on actuarial estimates.
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables.
The working capital adjustment was settled in the second quarter of 2018 and the balance sheet holdback is recorded in payables and other current liabilities on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as it is anticipated to be paid in the next twelve months.

As of March 31, 2018, the Company completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with no additional adjustments.
The Company believes these items would be available from other sources, but that the loss of certain suppliers would result in a higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality control costs in the short term.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company recognized discrete net tax benefits related to pension plan contributions and termination costs (2018 only) as well as the excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation of $6.0 million and $0.2 million, respectively.
The Company applies the accounting standards for fair value measurements and disclosures for its financial assets and financial liabilities.
The Company is currently assessing the impact that this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements.
The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.
Under the ASU, the service cost of net periodic benefit expense is an operating expense that will be reported with similar compensation costs.
The ASU was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018.
In the Consolidated Statements of Operations, the Company previously recorded service and other (benefits) costs in operating cost and expense accounts along with compensation costs.
increased operating earnings for 2018 by $11.8 and $19.8 million in the three- and nine-month periods ending September 30, 2018.

The Company does not anticipate that the adoption of ASU 2017-04 will have an impact.
On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2014-09 using the modified retrospective method applied to those contracts that were not completed or substantially complete as of January 1, 2018.
Results for the reporting period beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under Topic 606, while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with the Company's historic accounting under Topic 605 "Revenue Recognition".
The Company recorded a net reduction to opening retained earnings of $0.1 million as of January 1, 2018 as a result of the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606.
The impact to revenues as a result of applying Topic 606 for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 were not material.
Contracts with each customer generally state the terms of the sale, including the description, quantity and price of each product or service.
Since the customer typically agrees to a stated rate and price in the contract that does not vary over the life of the contract, the majority of the Company's contracts do not contain variable consideration.
The Company establishes a provision for estimated warranty and returns as well as certain after sale costs as discussed in Note 2 "Additional Financial Information Disclosures." 
The balance of contract assets was immaterial as the Company did not have a significant amount of uninvoiced receivables in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 and December 31, 2017.
The amount of revenue recognized in the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018 that was included in the opening contract liability balance was $0.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively.
The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company's contract liabilities was the result of a timing difference between the Company's performance and the customers' prepayments.
A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of measurement in Topic 606.
At contract inception, the Company assesses the products and services promised in its contracts with customers.
The Company then identifies performance obligations to transfer distinct products or services to the customer.
In order to identify performance obligations, the Company considers all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices.
The Company's performance obligations are satisfied at a point in time or over time as work progresses.
Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a single point in time accounted for 96.9% and 97.2% of net sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
The majority of the Company's revenue recognized at a point in time is for the sale of municipal and flow instrumentation products.
Revenue from services transferred to customers over time accounted for 3.1% and 2.8% of sales of net sales for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018, respectively.
The majority of the Company's revenue that is recognized over time relates to the BEACON AMA software as a service.
As of September 30, 2018, the Company had certain contracts where there were unsatisfied performance obligations.
For contracts recorded as long-term liabilities, $11.6 million was the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied as of the end of the reporting period.
The Company estimates that revenue recognized from satisfying those performance obligations will be approximately $0.6 million for the remainder of 2018, $2.6 million in each year from 2019 through 2022 and $0.6 million in 2023.
The Company records revenue for BEACON AMA services over time as the customer benefits from the data that is provided through the Company's software.
Control of an asset is therefore transferred to the customer over time, and the Company will recognize revenue for BEACON AMA services as service units are used by the customer.
The Company also has contracts that include both the sale and installation of flow meters as performance obligations.
In those cases, the Company records revenue for installed flow meters at the point in time when the flow meters have been accepted by the customer.
Therefore, for both the flow meter and the related installation, the Company has concluded that control is transferred to the customer upon customer acceptance of the installed flow meter.
The types and composition of the Company's revenue streams did not materially change during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2018.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract's transaction price to each performance obligation using the best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in a contract.
In accordance with Subtopic 340-40 "Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers," the Company elected to expense the incremental costs of obtaining a contract when the amortization period for such contracts would have been one year or less.
The Company does not disclose the value of unsatisfied performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less, and contracts for which it has the right to invoice for services performed.

Municipal water, the largest category by sales volume, includes mechanical and ultrasonic (electronic) water meters and related technologies and services used by municipal water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues.
The key market for the Company’s municipal water meter products is North America, primarily the United States, because most of the Company's meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.
The majority of water meters sold by the Company continue to be mechanical in nature.
In recent years, the Company has made inroads in selling ultrasonic water meters.
The development of smaller diameter ultrasonic water meters combined with advanced radio technology now provides the Company with the opportunity to sell into other geographical markets, for example Europe, the Middle East and South America.
In the municipal water category, sales of water meters and related technologies and services are also commonly referred to as residential or commercial water meter sales, the latter referring to larger sizes of water meters.
The Company’s BEACON AMA Managed Solution is the latest in metering technology.
Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.
The Company estimates that approximately 55% to 60% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to a radio solutions technology.
Flow instrumentation products serve flow measurement and control applications across a broad industrial spectrum, occasionally leveraging the same technologies used in the municipal water category.
The Company’s specific flow measurement and control applications and technologies serve the flow measurement market through both customized and standard flow instrumentation solutions.
An industry leader in both mechanical and electrical flow metering technologies, the Company offers one of the broadest flow measurement, control and communication portfolios in the market.
Customers rely on the Company for application-specific solutions that deliver accurate, timely and dependable flow data and control essential for product quality, cost control, safer operations, regulatory compliance, and more sustainable operations.
There are approximately 52,000 water utilities in the United States and the Company estimates that approximately 55% to 60% of them have converted to a radio solutions technology.
With the BEACON AMA managed solution and its wide breadth of water meters, the Company believes it is well positioned to meet customers' future needs.
On April 2, 2018, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of Innovative Metering Solutions, Inc.
The total purchase consideration was approximately $12.0 million, which included $7.7 million in cash, a $0.3 million working capital adjustment, a balance sheet holdback of $0.7 million and settlement of $3.3 million of pre-existing Company receivables.

As of March 31, 2018, the Company completed its analysis for estimating the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with no additional adjustments.
In 2011, the Company introduced AMA as a hardware and software solution for water and gas utilities, and then in early 2014 launched its new BEACON AMA system, as a managed solution, which it believes will help maintain the Company's position as a market leader.
Since its inception, sales of BEACON AMA have continued to grow with large cities and private water utilities selecting BEACON AMA and the Company’s industry-leading water meters.
The Company also supports its product and technology sales with the sale of extended service programs that provide additional services beyond the standard warranty.
In recent years, the Company has sold ORION radio technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters.
The Company’s net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $10.6 million, or 11%, to $110.6 million compared to $100.0 million during the same period in 2017.
The increase was due to higher sales in the residential market in both North America and the Middle East, pricing actions, higher service revenue and a greater mix of newer technology meters and related radios.
The Company’s net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 increased $23.5 million, or 8%, to $329.3 million compared to $305.8 million during the same period in 2017.
These sales increased $22.0 million, or 9%, to $255.0 million in the first nine months of 2018 from $233.0 million in 2017 and were driven by pricing actions, increased domestic volumes of newer meter technologies and related radios as well as higher service revenue.
These sales increased $1.5 million, or 2%, to $74.3 million for the first nine months in 2018 compared to $72.8 million in the same period last year due to higher sales into the oil and gas market as well as other targeted markets.
Receivables increased from $58.2 million at December 31, 2017 to $70.0 million at September 30, 2018.
Intangible assets decreased to $57.3 million at September 30, 2018 from $59.3 million at December 31, 2017 due to normal amortization expense, offset by an increase of $3.7 million related to the April 2018 acquisition of IMS.
The IMS acquisition was also the main reason for the increase in goodwill from $67.4 million on December 31, 2017 to $71.3 million on September 30, 2018.
In June 2018, the Company amended its May 2012 credit agreement with its primary lender to extend until September 2021 the $125.0 million line of credit that supports commercial paper (up to $70.0 million) and includes $5.0 million of a Euro line of credit.
The Company believes that its operating cash flows, available borrowing capacity, and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, future capital expenditures and the development of new products.
The Company had $97.9 million of unused credit lines available at September 30, 2018.
