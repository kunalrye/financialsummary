We derive revenue from the sale of integrated hardware and software, third-party service contracts, professional services, managed services, financing of hardware and software, and other services.
We recognize revenue from third-party service contracts as either gross sales or net sales depending on whether the Company is acting as a principal party to the transaction or simply acting as an agent or broker based on control and timing.
The Company is a principal if it controls the good or service before that good or service is transferred to the customer.
We record revenue as gross when the Company is a principal party to the arrangement and net of cost when we are acting as a broker or agent.
Under gross sales recognition, the entire selling price is recorded in revenue and our cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded in cost of goods sold.
Under net sales recognition, the cost to the third-party service provider or vendor is recorded as a reduction to revenue resulting in net sales equal to the gross profit on the transaction.
Third-party service contracts are sold in different combinations with hardware, software, and services.
We have determined the third-party services contracts 
Professional services are considered a series of distinct services that form one performance obligation and revenue is recognized over time as services are performed.
Revenue generated from managed services is recognized over the term of the contract.
Certain managed services contracts include financing of hardware and software.
Other services generally include revenue generated through our royalty, extended warranty, multicomputer repair, and maintenance contracts.
Revenue from extended warranty contracts is recognized evenly over the period of the warranty.
Multicomputer repair services revenue is recognized upon control transfer when the customer takes possession of the computer at time of shipping.
Revenue generated from maintenance services is recognized evenly over the term of the contract.
HPP segment revenue is derived from the sale of integrated hardware and software, maintenance, and other services through the Multicomputer and Myricom product lines.
Myricom revenue is derived from the sale of products, which are comprised of both hardware and embedded software which is essential to the products functionality, and post contract maintenance and support.
TS Segment revenue is derived from the sale of hardware, software, professional services, third-party service contracts, maintenance contracts, managed services, and financing of hardware and software.
Financing revenue is recorded in revenue as equipment leasing and is part of the Company's operations.
The input method using labor hours expended relative to the total expected hours is used to recognize revenue for professional services.
An estimate for professional services is made at the beginning of each contract based on prior experience and monitored throughout the services.
For items sold separately, including hardware, software, professional services, maintenance contracts, other services, and third-party service contracts, there is no allocation performed as there is one performance obligation.
When the Company has performed work but does not have an unconditional right to payment, a contract asset is recorded.
When the Company has the right to bill a customer, accounts receivable is recorded as an unconditional right exists.
Current contract assets were $708 thousand and $1.1 million as of March 31, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively.
There were no non-current contract assets as of March 31, 2019 and October 1, 2018.
Contract liabilities arise when payment is received before the Company transfers a good or service to the customer.
Current contract liabilities were $3.1 million and $0.9 million as of March 31, 2019 and October 1, 2018, respectively.
The current portion of contract liabilities is recorded in deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets.

Revenue recognized for the six months ended March 31, 2019 that was included in contract liabilities as of the beginning of the period was $0.5 million.
Most of the Company’s contracts are less than one year.
As a practical expedient, the Company has elected not to adjust the amount of consideration for effects of a significant financing component when it is anticipated the promised good or service will be transferred and the subsequent payment will be one year or less.
Finished goods includes inventory that has been shipped, but for which all revenue recognition criteria has not been met, of approximately $1.1 million and $0.7 million as of March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively.
