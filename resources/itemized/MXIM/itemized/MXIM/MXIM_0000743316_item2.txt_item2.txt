ITEM 2: UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS

On July 20, 2017, the board of directors of the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock.
The stock repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and the pace of repurchase activity will depend on factors such as current stock price, levels of cash generation from operations, cash requirements, and other factors.
The Company's prior repurchase authorization was cancelled and superseded by this new repurchase authorization.
In the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of its common stock for approximately $127.7 million.
As of March 31, 2018, the Company had remaining authorization of $746.4 million for future share repurchases.
The number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors, including the price of the Company’s common stock and general market and business conditions.
