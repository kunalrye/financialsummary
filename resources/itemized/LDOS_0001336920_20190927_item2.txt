Overview



We are a FORTUNE 500® science, engineering and information technology company that provides services and solutions in the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. We bring domain-specific capability and cross-market innovations to customers in each of these markets by leveraging seven core capabilities: cyber; digital modernization; integrated systems; mission software systems; mission support; operations and logistics; and sensors, collection and phenomenology. Our domestic customers include the U.S. Department of Defense ("DoD"), the U.S. Intelligence Community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs and many other U.S. government civilian agencies, as well as state and local government agencies. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in Australia and the United Kingdom ("U.K."). We operate in three reportable segments: Defense Solutions, Civil and Health. Additionally, we separately present the costs associated with corporate functions as Corporate.



Effective the beginning of fiscal 2019, we changed the composition of our Defense Solutions reportable segment to better align the operations within the reportable segment to the customers we serve. This resulted in the identification of new operating segments within Defense Solutions. In addition, certain contracts were reassigned between the Civil and Defense Solutions reportable segments. While this activity did not have a material impact on our reportable segments, prior year segment results have been recast to reflect this change. 



Business Environment and Trends 



U.S. Government Markets



During the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, we generated approximately 87% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. government. Accordingly, our business performance is affected by the overall level of U.S. government spending, especially on national security, homeland security and intelligence, and the alignment of our service and product offerings and capabilities with current and future budget priorities of the U.S. government.



In September 2018, Congress passed and the President signed a consolidated appropriations bill funding the Departments of Defense, Labor, and Health and Human Services for the full government fiscal year ("GFY") 2019. Earlier in 2018, funding for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Energy as well as funding for Congress were also enacted. All were funded at increased levels from the previous year. 



The remaining seven appropriations bills were operating under a continuing resolution ("CR") until it expired on December 21, 2018. From the expiration of that CR until the passage of a new CR on January 25, 2019 there was a partial U.S. government shutdown, which reduced or delayed work on existing contracts and caused delays in other government contracting actions and payments. Prior to the expiration of the January CR, Congress passed appropriations for the seven remaining appropriations bills, thereby completing funding for GFY 2019.



In March 2019, the President submitted the GFY 2020 budget proposal to Congress. The budget included $750 billion for defense and $563 billion for non-defense spending. The defense budget proposal included $576 billion for national defense and $165 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund.

On July 22, 2019, the White House and Congress reached a tentative two-year budget deal to raise spending caps and suspend the debt ceiling until July 2021. Allocations for national defense spending increased to $738 billion in GFY 2020 and to $741 billion in GFY 2021. For non-defense programs, spending increased to $632 billion in GFY 2020 and $635 billion in GFY 2021. Overall, the measure increased spending by $323 billion over the limits set under the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. 



Congress is currently addressing the passage of appropriations bills for GFY 2020. A CR was enacted on September 27, 2019, providing funding at GFY 2019 enacted levels until November 21, 2019.



International Markets



Sales to customers in international markets represented approximately 8% of total revenues for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019. Our international customers include foreign governments and their agencies, primarily located in Australia and the U.K. Our international business increases our exposure to international markets and the associated international regulatory and geopolitical risks.



Recent changes in international trade policies, including higher tariffs on imported goods and materials, may increase our procurement costs of certain IT hardware used both on our contracts and for internal use. However, we expect to recover certain portions of these higher tariffs through our cost-plus contracts. While we are still evaluating the impact of higher tariffs, currently, we do not expect tariffs to have a significant impact to our business.



Results of Operations



The following table summarizes our condensed consolidated results of operations for the periods presented:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The increase in revenues in constant currency(1) for the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, was 10.6% and 8.4%, as compared to an actual increase in revenues of 10.1% and 7.9%, respectively. The foreign currency impact was mainly attributable to adverse exchange rate movements in the British pound and Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar. 



_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________



(1) The non-GAAP measure of constant currency revenues is used to assess the performance of revenue activity without the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We calculate revenues on a constant currency basis by translating current period revenue using the foreign currency exchange rates of the comparable prior year periods. This calculation is performed for all subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar.

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The increase in revenues for the three months ended September 27, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 28, 2018, was primarily attributable to new awards and a net increase in program volumes, partially offset by the completion of certain contracts.



The increase in revenues for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2018, was primarily attributable to new awards and a net increase in program volumes, partially offset by the completion of certain contracts, lower net profit write-ups in the current year and adverse exchange rate movements in the Australian dollar when compared to the U.S. dollar.



The increase in operating income for the three months ended September 27, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 28, 2018, was primarily due to new awards and favorable program mix, partially offset by lower net profit write-ups in the current quarter.



The increase in operating income for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2018, was primarily due to new awards and lower amortization of intangibles, partially offset by lower net profit write-ups in the current year.

NM - Not meaningful



The increase in operating income for the three months ended September 27, 2019, as compared to the three months ended September 28, 2018, was primarily attributable to the receipt of the Greek arbitration award and lower integration and restructuring costs.



The increase in operating income for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, as compared to the nine months ended September 28, 2018, was primarily attributable to the receipt of the Greek arbitration award, lower integration and restructuring costs and an asset impairment charge in the prior year.



Non-Operating Expense, net



Non-operating expense, net of $35 million for the three months ended September 27, 2019 was consistent with the non-operating expense, net of $33 million for the three months ended September 28, 2018.



Non-operating expense, net for the nine months ended September 27, 2019 was $12 million as compared to $101 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2018. The $89 million decrease was primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business.



Provision for Income Taxes



For the three months ended September 27, 2019, our effective tax rate was 24.3% compared to 13.5% for the three months ended September 28, 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits in the current quarter and a release of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward in the prior year quarter.



For the nine months ended September 27, 2019, our effective tax rate was 23.5% compared to 14.3% for the nine months ended September 28, 2018. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recording of a valuation allowance related to foreign tax credits and an increase in unrecognized tax benefits in the current year. Additionally, during the prior year, tax benefits were recognized related to the anticipated sale of our commercial cybersecurity business and the release of a valuation allowance related to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward.



Bookings and Backlog 



We recorded net bookings worth an estimated $5.2 billion and $11.5 billion during the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, respectively, as compared to $4.6 billion and $10.5 billion for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2018, respectively.

LEIDOS HOLDINGS, INC.



The estimated value of our total backlog was as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The decrease in backlog within the Civil segment was primarily due to $154 million related to the sale of our commercial cybersecurity business in the first quarter of 2019.



Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts, both funded and unfunded. Backlog does not include unexercised option periods and future potential task orders expected to be awarded under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity ("IDIQ") contracts with the exception of certain IDIQ contracts where task orders are not competitively awarded and separately priced but instead are used as a funding mechanism, and where there is a basis for estimating future revenues and funding on future task orders is anticipated. Backlog estimates are subject to change and may be affected by factors including modifications of contracts and foreign currency movements.



Liquidity and Capital Resources 



Overview



As of September 27, 2019, we had $635 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, we have a secured revolving credit facility which can provide up to $750 million in additional borrowing, if required. As of September 27, 2019, there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility and we were in compliance with related financial covenants.



At September 27, 2019, and December 28, 2018, we had outstanding debt of $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. We made principal payments on our long-term debt of $2 million and $50 million during the three and nine months ended September 27, 2019, respectively, and $15 million and $59 million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2018, respectively. This activity included principal payments on our senior secured term loans of $41 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2019 and $15 million and $46 million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2018, respectively. There were no principal payments on our senior secured term loans for the quarter ended September 27, 2019. In April 2018, we made a required debt prepayment of $10 million on our senior secured term loans. The prepayment was a result of the annual excess cash flow calculation clause in our credit agreements. The notes outstanding as of September 27, 2019, contain financial covenants and customary restrictive covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants as of September 27, 2019. 



We paid dividends of $101 million during the nine months ended September 27, 2019, and $48 million and $151 million during the three and nine months ended September 28, 2018, respectively. Our quarterly dividend for the three months ended September 27, 2019, was paid on September 30, 2019.

For the next 12 months, we anticipate that we will be able to meet our liquidity needs, including servicing our debt, through cash generated from operations, available cash balances and, if needed, borrowings from our revolving credit facility. 



Summary of Cash Flows



 The following table summarizes cash flow information for the periods presented:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $22 million for the three months ended September 27, 2019, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rates swaps in the prior year quarter, the prefunding of our quarterly dividend and higher tax payments. These activities were partially offset by more favorable timing of working capital changes and $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award. 



Net cash provided by operating activities increased $159 million for the nine months ended September 27, 2019, when compared to the prior year, primarily due to more favorable timing of working capital changes, $59 million received for the Greek arbitration award, lower payments for integration and restructuring costs and $24 million of cash paid in the prior year related to our 2016 acquisition. These activities were partially offset by higher tax payments, $60 million of proceeds received from the termination of interest rates swaps in the prior year and the prefunding of our quarterly dividend.



Net cash used in investing activities increased $117 million for the three months ended September 27, 2019, when compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to $94 million of cash paid related to the acquisition of IMX and $40 million of proceeds received from the settlement of a promissory note in the prior year quarter, partially offset by $12 million of net proceeds received for the divestiture of our health staff augmentation business.
