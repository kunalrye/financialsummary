Effective January 1, 2018, we adopted the requirements of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as amended ("Topic 606"), utilizing the full retrospective method as discussed in Note 2 (Recent Accounting Pronouncements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.

Key factors affecting our financial performance
•Changes in spending policies, budget priorities and funding levels are a key factor influencing the purchasing levels of government, healthcare and education customers. 
We monitor a number of financial and non-financial measures and ratios on a regular basis in order to track the progress of our business and make adjustments as necessary. We believe that the most important of these measures and ratios include average daily sales, gross margin, operating margin, Net income, Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Net income per common share, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin, free cash flow, return on working capital, Cash and cash equivalents, net working capital, cash conversion cycle (defined to be days of sales outstanding in Accounts receivable plus days of supply in Inventory minus days of purchases outstanding in Accounts payable, based on a rolling three-month average), debt levels including available credit and leverage ratios, sales per coworker and coworker turnover. These measures and ratios are compared to standards or objectives set by management, so that actions can be taken, as necessary, in order to achieve the standards and objectives.
In this Form 10-Q, we discuss Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, Non-GAAP net income per diluted share, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures.
Three Months Ended September 30, 2018 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 
Net sales
Total Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $440 million, or 11.2%, to $4,373 million, compared to $3,933 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, constant currency Net sales growth was 11.4%. See "Non-GAAP Financial Measure Reconciliations" below for additional information regarding constant currency Net sales growth.
For the three months ended September 30, 2018, Net sales growth reflected balanced growth across transactions and solutions. Transactional growth was primarily driven by client devices. Solutions growth was driven primarily by software, servers, networking and enterprise storage. Additionally, strong results from our international operations contributed to our Net sales growth. 
Corporate segment Net sales for the three months ended September 30, 2018 increased $154 million, or 9.9%, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017. Growth was primarily driven by client device refresh.

Gross profit

As a percentage of Net sales, Gross profit margin remained flat versus prior year at 16.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2018.

Selling and administrative expenses increased $39 million, or 11.0%, to $391 million for the three months ended September 30, 2018, compared to $352 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. The increase was driven by higher sales payroll costs, including sales commissions consistent with higher Gross profit dollars, higher coworker costs driven by attainment for performance-based compensation and strategic investments funded by tax reform. Total coworker count was 8,937, up 215 from 8,722 at September 30, 2017. Total coworker count was 8,726 at December 31, 2017.

We have included reconciliations of Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 below. 
Non-GAAP income before income taxes and Non-GAAP net income exclude, among other things, charges related to the amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, equity-based compensation and associated taxes, gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt and integration expenses. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, net, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a measure defined in our credit agreements, means EBITDA adjusted for certain items, which are described in the tables below. Adjusted EBITDA margin is defined as Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net sales. Consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis is defined as consolidated Net sales growth excluding the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales compared to the prior period.
Non-GAAP income before income taxes, Non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and consolidated Net sales growth on a constant currency basis are considered non-GAAP financial measures. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's performance or financial position that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally included or excluded in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP measures used by management may differ from similar measures used by other companies, even when similar terms are used to identify such measures.

Dividends
Operating Activities  
Investing Activities
Net cash used in investing activities decreased by $6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior year. Capital expenditures were $53 million and $59 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the timing of investments for improvements to our information technology systems. 
Financing Activities
Net cash used in financing activities decreased by $112 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2018 compared to the same period of the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by fewer share repurchases during the nine months ended September 30, 2018, which resulted in a $301 million decrease in cash used in financing activities. The decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by reduced borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, which resulted in net cash outflows of $185 million. For more information regarding our debt and refinancing activities, see Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
As of September 30, 2018, we had total indebtedness of $3.2 billion, of which $1.5 billion was secured indebtedness.

These amounts are classified separately as Accounts payable-inventory financing on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not incur any interest expense associated with these agreements as balances are paid when they are due. For further details, see Note 3 (Inventory Financing Agreements) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements.
Except as disclosed under Note 6 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements, there have been no material changes to our contractual obligations from those reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017.
