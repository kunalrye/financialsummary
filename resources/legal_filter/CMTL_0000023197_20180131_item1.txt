NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



(Unaudited)



(1) General 



The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Comtech Telecommunications Corp. and its subsidiaries ("Comtech," "we," "us," or "our") as of and for the three and six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 are unaudited.
In the opinion of management, the information furnished reflects all material adjustments (which include normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the unaudited interim periods.
As disclosed in more detail in Note (14) - "Segment Information," we manage our business in two reportable segments: Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions.
Certain reclassifications have been made to previously reported condensed consolidated financial statements to conform to the current fiscal period presentation.
(2) Adoption of Accounting Standards and Updates



We are required to prepare our condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") which is the source for all authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which are commonly referred to as "GAAP."
The FASB ASC is subject to updates by the FASB, which are known as Accounting Standards Updates ("ASUs").
During the six months ended January 31, 2018, we adopted FASB ASU 2016-09 "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"), which amends several aspects of the accounting for and reporting of share-based payment transactions.
Our adoption of this ASU, on August 1, 2017, did not have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements.
See Note (12) - "Stock-Based Compensation" for further information regarding our adoption of this ASU.
(3) Fair Value Measurements and Financial Instruments



Using the fair value hierarchy described in FASB ASC 820 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," we valued our cash and cash equivalents using Level 1 inputs that were based on quoted market prices.
The fair value of the non-current portion of our Secured Credit Facility as of January 31, 2018 approximates its carrying amount due to its variable interest rate and pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
We believe the fair value of our non-current portion of capital lease obligations, which currently has a blended interest rate of 5.9%, would not be materially different than its carrying value as of January 31, 2018.
The fair value of the non-current portion of our favorable AT&T warranty settlement as of January 31, 2018 approximates its carrying amount given our belief that the present value of such liability reflects market participants' assumptions for a similar junior, unsecured debt instrument.
See Note (7) - "Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities" for further discussion of the favorable AT&T warranty settlement.
(4) Earnings Per Share 



Our basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares (including vested but unissued stock units, share units, performance shares and restricted stock units ("RSUs")), outstanding during each respective period.
Our diluted EPS reflects the dilution from potential common stock issuable pursuant to the exercise of equity-classified stock-based awards, if dilutive, outstanding during each respective period.
Pursuant to FASB ASC 260 "Earnings Per Share," equity-classified stock-based awards that are subject to performance conditions are not considered in our diluted EPS calculations until the respective performance conditions have been satisfied.
When calculating our diluted earnings per share, we consider the amount an employee must pay upon assumed exercise of stock-based awards and the amount of stock-based compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized.
On August 1, 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-09, which amends several aspects of the accounting for and reporting of share-based payment transactions.
As a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09, the amount of excess tax benefits assuming exercise of in-the-money stock-based awards is no longer included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share on a prospective basis and the denominator for our diluted calculations could increase in the future as compared to prior calculations.
See Note (12) - "Stock-Based Compensation" for more information on the impact of adopting ASU 2016-09.
There were no purchases of our common stock during the six months ended January 31, 2018 or 2017.
See Note (17) - "Stockholders’ Equity" for more information.
Weighted average stock options, RSUs and restricted stock outstanding of 1,812,000 and 2,173,000 for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 1,821,000 and 2,305,000 for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were not included in our diluted EPS calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.
Our EPS calculations exclude 259,000 and 237,000 weighted average performance shares outstanding for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 211,000 and 229,000 weighted average performance shares outstanding for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as the performance conditions have not yet been satisfied.
However, the compensation expense related to these awards is included in net income (the numerator) for EPS calculations for each respective period.
The following table reconciles the numerators and denominators used in the basic and diluted EPS calculations:

(5) Accounts Receivable



Accounts receivable consist of the following at:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Unbilled receivables relate to contracts-in-progress for which revenue has been recognized but we have not yet billed the customer for work performed.
We had $125,000 and $118,000 of retainage included in unbilled receivables at January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017, respectively, and management estimates that substantially all of the unbilled receivables at January 31, 2018 will be billed and collected within one year.
Of the unbilled receivables from commercial and international customers at January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017, approximately $2,012,000 and $2,995,000, respectively, relates to a large over-the-horizon microwave system contract with our large U.S. prime contractor customer (all of which related to our North African country end-customer).
As of January 31, 2018, the U.S. government (and its agencies) and Verizon Communications Inc. (through various divisions and, collectively, "Verizon") represented 30.6% and 12.0%, respectively, of total accounts receivable.
As of July 31, 2017, except for the U.S. government (and its agencies), which represented 23.9% of total accounts receivable, there were no other customers which accounted for greater than 10.0% of total accounts receivable.
(6) Inventories



Inventories consist of the following at:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

Accrued expenses and other current liabilities consist of the following at:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Accrued legal costs as of January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017 include $3,623,000 and $4,120,000, respectively, related to estimated costs associated with certain TeleCommunication Systems, Inc. ("TCS") intellectual property matters.
The accrued potential settlement costs do not reflect the final amounts we may actually pay.
TCS intellectual property matters are discussed in more detail in Note (18) - "Legal Proceedings and Other Matters."
Accrued warranty obligations relate to estimated liabilities for warranty coverage that we provide to our customers.
We generally provide warranty coverage for some of our products for a period of at least one year from the date of delivery.
Changes in our current accrued warranty obligations during the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 were as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our current accrued warranty obligations at January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017 include $5,234,000 and $9,909,000, respectively, of warranty obligations for a small product line that we refer to as the TCS 911 call handling software solution.
This solution was licensed to customers prior to our acquisition of TCS.
During the six months ended January 31, 2018, we entered into a full and final warranty settlement with AT&T, the largest customer/distributor of this product line, pursuant to which we issued thirty-six credits to AT&T of $153,000 which AT&T can apply on a monthly basis to purchases of solutions from us, beginning October 2017 through September 2020.
In connection with this favorable settlement, during the six months ended January 31, 2018, we recorded a benefit to cost of sales of $660,000.

(8) Acquisition-Related Restructuring Plans



Radyne 



In connection with our August 1, 2008 acquisition of Radyne, we adopted a restructuring plan for which we recorded $2,713,000 of estimated restructuring costs.
Of this amount, $613,000 related to severance for Radyne employees which was paid in fiscal 2009.
The remaining estimated amounts relate to facility exit costs and were determined as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our total non-cancelable lease obligations were based on the actual lease term which runs from November 1, 2008 through October 31, 2018.
We estimated sublease income based on (i) the terms of a fully executed sublease agreement that expired on October 31, 2015, and (ii) our assessment of future uncertainties relating to the commercial real estate market.
As such, in accordance with grandfathered accounting standards that were not incorporated into the FASB’s ASC, we recorded these costs, at fair value, as assumed liabilities as of August 1, 2008, with a corresponding increase to goodwill.
As of January 31, 2018, the amount of the acquisition-related restructuring reserve is as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



As of July 31, 2017, the present value of the estimated facility exit costs was $1,941,000.
During the six months ended January 31, 2018, we made cash payments of $805,000.
Interest accreted for the three and six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 was $25,000 and $57,000, respectively, and $51,000 and $107,000, respectively, and is included in interest expense for each respective fiscal period.
Future cash payments associated with our restructuring plan are summarized below:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



TCS 



In connection with our February 23, 2016 acquisition of TCS, we continue to implement a tactical shift in strategy in our Government Solutions segment and have initiated certain cost reduction actions.
To date, we have incurred an immaterial amount of severance and retention costs related to our shift in strategy.

(9) Secured Credit Facility 



On February 23, 2016, in connection with our acquisition of TCS, we entered into a $400,000,000 secured credit facility (the "Secured Credit Facility") with a syndicate of lenders.
The Secured Credit Facility, as amended June 6, 2017 (the "June 2017 Amendment"), comprises a senior secured term loan A facility of $250,000,000 (the "Term Loan Facility") and a secured revolving loan facility of up to $150,000,000, including a $25,000,000 letter of credit sublimit (the "Revolving Loan Facility") and, together, with the Term Loan Facility, matures on February 23, 2021.
The proceeds of these borrowings were primarily used to finance our acquisition of TCS, including the repayment of certain existing indebtedness of TCS.
The Term Loan Facility requires mandatory quarterly repayments.
During the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, we repaid $10,354,000 and $4,427,000, respectively, principal amount of borrowings under the Term Loan Facility.
Under the Revolving Loan Facility, we had outstanding balances ranging from $41,904,000 to $66,804,000 during the six months ended January 31, 2018.
As of January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017, amounts outstanding under our Secured Credit Facility, net, were as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Interest expense, including amortization of deferred financing costs, recorded during the three and six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 related to the Secured Credit Facility was $2,350,000 and $4,815,000, respectively, and $2,708,000 and $5,883,000, respectively, and reflects a blended interest rate of approximately 5.10% and 5.06% for the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 5.20% and 4.79% for the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
The Revolving Loan Facility is primarily used for working capital and other general corporate purposes of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the issuance of letters of credit.
Borrowings under the Secured Credit Facility, pursuant to terms defined in the Secured Credit Facility, shall be either (i) Alternate Base Rate ("ABR") borrowings, which bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to (x) the greatest of (a) the Prime Rate in effect on such day, (b) the Federal Funds Effective Rate in effect on such day plus 0.50% per annum and (c) the Adjusted LIBO Rate on such day (or, if such day is not a business day, the immediately preceding business day) plus 1.00% per annum (provided that if the LIBO Rate is less than 1.00%, then the LIBO Rate shall be deemed to be 1.00%), plus (y) the Applicable Rate, or (ii) Eurodollar borrowings, which bear interest from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to (x) the Adjusted LIBO Rate for such interest period (provided that if the LIBO Rate is less than 1.00%, then the LIBO Rate shall be deemed to be 1.00%) plus (y) the Applicable Rate.
The Applicable Rate is determined based on a pricing grid that is dependent upon our leverage ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
The Secured Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants and customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate), such as payment defaults, cross-defaults to other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency, the occurrence of a defined change in control and the failure to observe the negative covenants and other covenants related to the operation of our business.

The June 2017 Amendment is expected to result in increased operating and acquisition flexibility and simplify the calculations of our financial covenants.
The June 2017 Amendment resulted in, among other things, that the:



(i)Consolidated EBITDA definition more closely aligns with our Adjusted EBITDA metric by eliminating favorable adjustments to operating income related to settlements of TCS intellectual property matters;



(ii)Leverage Ratio is calculated on a "gross" basis using the quotient of Total Indebtedness (excluding unamortized deferred financing costs) divided by our TTM Consolidated EBITDA.
The prior Leverage Ratio was calculated on a "net" basis but did not include a reduction for any cash or cash equivalents above $50,000,000; 



(iii)Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio includes a deduction for all cash dividends, regardless of the amount of our cash and cash equivalents and the related allowable Quarterly Dividend Amount, as defined, will now align with our current quarterly dividend target of $0.10 per common share;



(iv)Balloon or final payment of the Term Loan Facility (which is not due until February 23, 2021) was reduced by $22,500,000 through increased borrowings from the Revolving Loan Facility (which does not expire until February 23, 2021); and 



(v)Leverage Ratios will be adjusted, in certain conditions, to provide for additional flexibility for us to make acquisitions.
In connection with the June 2017 Amendment, there were no changes to: (i) the committed borrowing capacity; (ii) the maturity date; or (iii) interest rates payable (except that the interest rate pricing grid will now be based on the new Leverage Ratio).
Also, the June 2017 Amendment did not result in an extinguishment for accounting purposes (as such term is defined in ASC 470 - "Debt"); instead, the June 2017 Amendment was accounted for as a debt modification.
As a result, deferred financing costs (including incremental fees for the June 2017 Amendment) will continue to be amortized over the remaining maturity term of the Secured Credit Facility.
As of January 31, 2018, our Leverage Ratio was 2.78x TTM Consolidated EBITDA compared to the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio of 3.35x TTM Consolidated EBITDA.
During the second half of fiscal 2018, the maximum allowable Leverage Ratio will decrease each quarter until reaching 3.00x TTM Consolidated EBITDA in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, with no further reductions thereafter.
Our Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as of January 31, 2018 was 2.09x compared to the minimum required Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.25x.
The Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio will not change for the remaining term of the Secured Credit Facility, as amended.
The obligations under the Secured Credit Facility, as amended, are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries (the "Subsidiary Guarantors").
As collateral security for amounts outstanding under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, and the guarantees thereof, we and our Subsidiary Guarantors have granted to an administrative agent, for the benefit of the lenders, a lien on, and first priority security interest in, substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets.
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the meanings set forth for such terms in the Secured Credit Facility, dated as of February 23, 2016, and the First Amendment of the Secured Credit Facility, dated as of June 6, 2017, both of which have been documented and filed with the SEC.
(10) Capital Lease Obligations



We lease certain equipment under capital leases.
As of January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017, the net book value of the leased assets which collateralize the capital lease obligations was $3,815,000 and $5,419,000, respectively, and consisted primarily of machinery and equipment.
As of January 31, 2018, our capital lease obligations reflect a blended interest rate of approximately 5.9%.
Our capital leases generally contain provisions whereby we can purchase the equipment at the end of the lease for a one dollar buyout.
Depreciation of leased assets is included in depreciation expense.
As such, our effective tax rate for accounting purposes in fiscal 2018, excluding discrete items, is now expected to approximate 27.75% as compared to our prior estimate of 34.5%.
In connection with Tax Reform, during the three months ended January 31, 2018, we recorded an estimated net discrete tax benefit of $14,018,000, primarily related to the remeasurement of deferred tax liabilities associated with non-deductible amortization related to intangible assets.
As such, we expect to finalize this net discrete tax benefit during the second half of fiscal 2018.
At January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017, total unrecognized tax benefits were $9,043,000 and $8,681,000, respectively, including interest of $147,000 and $95,000, respectively.
The remaining unrecognized tax benefits of $6,485,000 and $6,166,000 at January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017, respectively, were presented as an offset to the associated non-current deferred tax assets in our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The Plan provides for the granting to employees and consultants of Comtech (including prospective employees and consultants): (i) incentive and non-qualified stock options, (ii) restricted stock units ("RSUs"), (iii) RSUs with performance measures (which we refer to as "performance shares"), (iv) restricted stock, (v) stock units (reserved for issuance to non-employee directors) and share units (reserved for issuance to employees) (collectively, "share units") and (vi) stock appreciation rights ("SARs"), among other types of awards.
Our non-employee directors are eligible to receive non-discretionary grants of stock-based awards, subject to certain limitations.
ASU 2016-09 also removes the prior requirement to delay recognition of excess tax benefits until it reduces current taxes payable; instead, we are now required to recognize excess tax benefits as discrete items in the interim period in which they occur, subject to normal valuation allowance considerations.
Diluted earnings per share - Prior to the adoption of ASU 2016-09, in addition to considering the amount an employee must pay upon assumed exercise of stock-based awards and the amount of stock-based compensation cost attributed to future services and not yet recognized, when calculating our diluted earnings per share, the assumed proceeds also included the amount of excess tax benefits, if any, that would have been credited to additional paid-in capital assuming exercise of in-the-money stock-based awards.
Effective with our adoption of ASU 2016-09, excess tax benefits are to be excluded from the calculation on a prospective basis.
Forfeitures - As permitted by ASU 2016-09, we elected to continue to estimate forfeitures of share-based awards.
To qualify, we must have at least some withholding obligation.
This aspect of adopting ASU 2016-09 did not have any material impact on us.
However, with respect to cash payments that we make to taxing authorities on behalf of employees for such shares withheld, on a retrospective basis, we are required to present such payments as a cash outflow from financing activities in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (as opposed to operating activities).
As of January 31, 2018, the aggregate number of shares of common stock which may be issued, pursuant to the Plan, may not exceed 10,362,500.
Stock options granted may not have a term exceeding ten years or, in the case of an incentive stock award granted to a stockholder who owns stock representing more than 10.0% of the voting power, no more than five years.
As of January 31, 2018, we had granted stock-based awards pursuant to the Plan representing the right to purchase and/or acquire an aggregate of 8,086,920 shares (net of 3,840,518 expired and canceled awards), of which an aggregate of 5,310,722 have been exercised or settled.

As of January 31, 2018, the following stock-based awards, by award type, were outstanding:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Our ESPP provides for the issuance of up to 800,000 shares of our common stock.
Our ESPP is intended to provide our eligible employees the opportunity to acquire our common stock at 85% of fair market value at the date of issuance.
Stock-based compensation for awards issued is reflected in the following line items in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Stock-based compensation for equity-classified awards is measured at the date of grant, based on an estimate of the fair value of the award and is generally expensed over the vesting period of the award.
At January 31, 2018, unrecognized stock-based compensation of $9,015,000, net of estimated forfeitures of $902,000, is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 3.0 years.
Total stock-based compensation capitalized and included in ending inventory at both January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017 was $12,000.
There are no liability-classified stock-based awards outstanding as of January 31, 2018 or July 31, 2017.
Stock-based compensation expense (benefit), by award type, is summarized as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



ESPP stock-based compensation expense primarily relates to the 15% discount offered to participants in the ESPP.
During the six months ended January 31, 2018, we recorded a $62,000 net benefit which primarily represents the recoupment of certain share units.
Stock Options



The following table summarizes the Plan's activity during the six months ended January 31, 2018:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Stock options outstanding as of January 31, 2018 have exercise prices ranging from $20.90 to $33.94, representing the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, a contractual term of five or ten years and a vesting period of three or five years.
There were no stock options granted or exercised during the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017.
As there were no exercises during the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017, there were no net settlements of stock options or the related issuance of common stock during the respective periods.
Performance Shares, RSUs, Restricted Stock and Share Unit Awards



The following table summarizes the Plan's activity relating to performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



The total intrinsic value relating to fully-vested awards settled during the three months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 was $11,000 and $208,000, respectively.
The total intrinsic value relating to fully-vested awards settled during the six months ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 was $1,948,000 and $633,000, respectively.

Performance shares granted to employees prior to fiscal 2014 generally vest over a 5.3 year period, beginning on the date of grant once pre-established performance goals were attained, and are convertible into shares of our common stock at the time of vesting, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration.
The performance shares granted to employees since fiscal 2014 principally vest over a three-year performance period, if pre-established performance goals are attained or as specified pursuant to the Plan and related agreements.
As of January 31, 2018, the number of outstanding performance shares included in the above table, and the related compensation expense prior to consideration of estimated pre-vesting forfeitures, assume achievement of the pre-established goals at a target level.
RSUs and restricted stock granted to non-employee directors have a vesting period of three years and are convertible into shares of our common stock generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
RSUs granted to employees have a vesting period of five years and are convertible into shares of our common stock generally at the time of vesting, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration.
Share units granted prior to July 31, 2017 were vested when issued and are convertible into shares of our common stock generally at the time of termination, on a one-for-one basis for no cash consideration, or earlier under certain circumstances.
Share units granted on or after July 31, 2017 were granted to certain employees in lieu of fiscal 2017 non-equity incentive compensation and are convertible into shares of our common stock on the one-year anniversary of the grant date.
Cumulatively through January 31, 2018, 14,777 share units granted have been settled.
The fair value of performance shares, RSUs, restricted stock and share units is determined using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant, less the present value of any estimated future dividend equivalents such awards are not entitled to receive and an applicable estimated discount for post vesting restrictions.
RSUs, performance shares and restricted stock granted since fiscal 2013 are entitled to dividend equivalents unless forfeited before vesting occurs; however, performance shares granted in fiscal 2013 were not entitled to such dividend equivalents until our Board of Directors determined that the pre-established performance goals were met.
Share units granted prior to fiscal 2014 are not entitled to dividend equivalents.
Share units granted since fiscal 2014 are entitled to dividend equivalents while the underlying shares are unissued.
Dividend equivalents are subject to forfeiture, similar to the terms of the underlying stock-based awards, and are payable in cash generally at the time of settlement of the underlying shares into our common stock.
During the six months ended January 31, 2018, we accrued $155,000 of dividend equivalents and paid out $128,000.
Accrued dividend equivalents were recorded as a reduction to retained earnings.
As of January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017, accrued dividend equivalents were $581,000 and $554,000, respectively.
We recorded $71,000 of income tax expense in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the six months ended January 31, 2018, which represents net income tax shortfalls from the settlement of stock-based awards and the reversal of deferred tax assets associated with expired and unexercised stock-based awards.
During the six months ended January 31, 2017, net income tax shortfalls from similar items totaled $601,000 and, pursuant to prior GAAP, were recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.

(14) Segment Information



Reportable operating segments are determined based on Comtech’s management approach.
The management approach, as defined by FASB ASC 280 "Segment Reporting" is based on the way that the chief operating decision-maker ("CODM") organizes the segments within an enterprise for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance.
Our CODM, for purposes of FASB ASC 280, is our Chief Executive Officer and President.
Our Commercial Solutions segment serves commercial customers and smaller government customers, such as state and local governments, that require advanced communications technologies to meet their needs.
This segment also serves certain large government customers (including the U.S. government) when they have requirements for off-the-shelf commercial equipment.
Commercial solutions products include satellite earth station communications equipment such as modems and traveling wave tube amplifiers, public safety technologies including those that are utilized in next generation 911 systems and enterprise technologies such as trusted location and text-messaging platforms.
Our Government Solutions segment serves large U.S. and foreign government end-users that require mission critical technologies and systems.
Government solutions products include command and control technologies (such as mobile satellite transceivers used on the Blue Force Tracking-1 and Blue Force Tracking-2 programs), troposcatter technologies systems (such as digital troposcatter multiplexers, digital over-the-horizon modems, troposcatter systems and frequency converter systems) and RF power and switching technologies products (such as solid-state high-power narrow and broadband amplifiers, enhanced position location reporting system ("EPLRS") amplifier assemblies, identification friend or foe amplifiers and amplifiers used in the counteraction of improvised explosive devices).
Our CODM primarily uses a metric that we refer to as Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") to measure an operating segment’s performance and to make decisions about resources to be allocated.
Although closely aligned, the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA is different than the Consolidated EBITDA (as such term is defined in our Secured Credit Facility, as amended) utilized for financial covenant calculations and also may differ from the definition of EBITDA or Adjusted EBITDA used by other companies and, therefore, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.

(15) Goodwill 



The following table represents goodwill by reportable operating segment as of January 31, 2018 and July 31, 2017:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



In accordance with FASB ASC 350 "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other," we perform a goodwill impairment analysis at least annually (in the first quarter of each fiscal year), unless indicators of impairment exist in interim periods.
If we fail the quantitative assessment of goodwill impairment ("quantitative assessment"), pursuant to our adoption of FASB ASU No.
2017-04 in fiscal 2017, we would be required to recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount that a reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value; however, any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.
On August 1, 2017 (the first day of our fiscal 2018), we performed our annual quantitative assessment using market participant assumptions to determine if the fair value of each of our reporting units with goodwill exceeded its carrying value.
In performing the quantitative assessment, we estimated the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the income and market approaches.
The income approach, also known as the discounted cash flow ("DCF") method, utilizes the present value of cash flows to estimate fair value.
The discount rates used in our DCF method were based on a weighted-average cost of capital ("WACC") determined from relevant market comparisons, adjusted upward for specific reporting unit risks (primarily the uncertainty of achieving projected operating cash flows).
A terminal value growth rate was applied to the final year of the projected period and reflected our estimate of stable, perpetual growth.
We then calculated a present value of the respective cash flows for each reporting unit to arrive at an estimate of fair value under the income approach.
Under the market approach, we estimated a fair value based on comparable companies' market multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and factored in a control premium.

Based on our quantitative evaluation, we determined that our Commercial Solutions and Government Solutions reporting units had estimated fair values in excess of their carrying values of at least 17.8% and 52.9%, respectively, and concluded that our goodwill was not impaired and that neither of our two reporting units was at risk of failing the quantitative assessment.
However, in order to sensitize our goodwill impairment test, we performed a second analysis using only the income approach and concluded that neither reporting units' goodwill was impaired or at risk of failing the quantitative assessment.
(16) Intangible Assets



Intangible assets with finite lives are as follows:

(17) Stockholders’ Equity



Sale of Common Stock



In June 2016, the Company sold 7,145,000 shares of its common stock in a public offering at a price to the public of $14.00 per share, resulting in proceeds to the Company of $95,029,000, net of underwriting discounts and commissions.
As of January 31, 2018 and March 7, 2018, an aggregate registered amount of $74,970,000 under the Company's existing Shelf Registration Statement filed with the SEC remains available for sale of various types of securities, including debt.
Stock Repurchase Program



As of January 31, 2018 and March 7, 2018, we were authorized to repurchase up to an additional $8,664,000 of our common stock, pursuant to our current $100,000,000 stock repurchase program.
There were no repurchases made during the six months ended January 31, 2018 or 2017.
Dividends 



Since September 2010, we have paid quarterly dividends pursuant to an annual targeted dividend amount that was established by our Board of Directors.
On September 27, 2017 and December 6, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, which was paid on November 17, 2017 and February 16, 2018, respectively.
On March 7, 2018, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.10 per common share, payable on May 18, 2018 to stockholders of record at the close of business on April 18, 2018.
Future dividends remain subject to compliance with financial covenants under our Secured Credit Facility, as amended, as well as Board approval.
In 2013, the District Court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment on the basis that the products in question did not infringe plaintiff’s patent.
Plaintiff appealed that decision and, in 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed the District Court's claim construction, overturned the District Court's grant of summary judgment of noninfringement, and remanded the case for further proceedings.
Fact discovery and expert discovery has closed.
Substantive settlement conversations have occurred but, to date, the parties have been unable to reach a settlement.
The accrued settlement costs related to this matter do not reflect the final amounts we actually may pay, if any.

On May 30, 2017, we received positive news that the District Court issued a supplemental claim construction order in our favor.
As a result, the plaintiff agreed to file a joint status report to the District Court that requested that the District Court cancel the trial date (which was scheduled for July 2017).
On July 28, 2017, the parties entered into a stipulation that the defendants’ accused products do not infringe Vehicle IP’s patent under the District Court’s current revised construction of the disputed patent claim term and requested that the District Court therefore enter a judgment of noninfringement.
On August 18, 2017, the court entered such a judgment of noninfringment.
As expected, following the judgment, Vehicle IP filed a notice of appeal on August 29, 2017.
Vehicle IP's opening brief on appeal of the District Court's claim construction was submitted in October 2017.
TCS’s brief in response was filed on January 19, 2018.
An appellate ruling may take a year or so to be issued.
Other Matters 



In October 2014, we disclosed to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") that we learned during a self-assessment of our export transactions that a shipment of modems sent to a Canadian customer by Comtech EF Data Corp. was incorporated into a communication system, the ultimate end user of which was the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority.
The sales value of this equipment was approximately $288,000.
At the time of shipment, OFAC regulations prohibited U.S. persons from doing business directly or indirectly with Sudan.
In late 2015, OFAC issued an administrative subpoena seeking further information about the disclosed transaction.
We have responded to the subpoena, including alerting OFAC to Comtech’s repair of three modems for a customer in Lebanon who may have rerouted the modems from Lebanon to Sudan without the required U.S. licensing authorization.
Subsequently, in October 2017, U.S. sanctions with respect to Sudan were revoked.
Consistent with the revocation of the Sudan Sanction Regulations ("SSR"), shipments to the Sudan Civil Aviation Authority by U.S. persons are now permissible.
Even though we take precautions to avoid engaging in transactions that may violate U.S. trade sanctions, those measures may not be effective in every instance.
There are certain other pending and threatened legal actions which arise in the normal course of business.
