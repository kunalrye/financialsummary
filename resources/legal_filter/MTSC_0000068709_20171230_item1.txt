NOTE 2 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



Revenue Recognition



In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and in August 2015, issued ASU No.
2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of Effective Date, which amended ASU No.
2014-09 as to the effective date of the standard.
The guidance, as amended, clarifies the principles for revenue recognition in transactions involving contracts with customers.
Determination of when and how revenue is recognized will be based on a five-step analysis.
The new guidance will require revenue recognition to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
The mandatory effective date of the new revenue recognition standard was deferred by one year under ASU No.
2015-14.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which amends ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), to clarify principal versus agent guidance in situations in which a revenue transaction involves a third party in providing goods or services to a customer.
In such circumstances, an entity must determine whether the nature of its promise to the customer is to provide the underlying goods or services (i.e., the entity is the principal in the transaction) or to arrange for the third party to provide the underlying goods or services (i.e., the entity is the agent in the transaction).
To determine the nature of its promise to the customer, the entity must first identify each specified good or service to be provided to the customer and then (before transferring it) assess whether it controls each specified good or service.
The new guidance clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting (the specified good or service) for the principal versus agent evaluation, and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements, such as service transactions, by explaining what a principal controls before the specified good or service is transferred to the customer.
In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, to amend ASU No.
6

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-11, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting (SEC Update), which rescinds previous guidance on revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process, accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer.
In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, which amends ASU No.
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), to clarify that, for a contract to be considered completed at transition, all (or substantially all) of the revenue must have been recognized under legacy GAAP.
The amendment also added an expedient to ease transition for contracts that were modified prior to adoption of the new revenue standard and clarifies both how an entity should evaluate the collectibility threshold and when an entity can recognize non-refundable considerations received as revenue if the arrangement does not meet the standard's contract criteria.
The amendment clarifies that fair value of non-cash considerations should be measured at contract inception when determining the transaction price and allows an entity to make an accounting policy election to exclude from the transaction price certain types of taxes collected from a customer if it discloses the policy.
In December 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), providing thirteen corrections and improvements to the new revenue standard.
The aforementioned revenue standards and amendments are required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2019.
The new standards and amendments may be adopted retrospectively for all periods presented, or adopted using a modified retrospective approach.
Early adoption is permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2018.
We currently anticipate utilizing the modified retrospective approach as our method of adoption.
We continue to evaluate our procedural and related system requirements related to the provisions of this standard.
Other 



In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 824), which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset, representing the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term, and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms greater than 12 months.
Lessees can forgo recognizing a right-of-use asset and lease liability with lease terms of 12 months or less on the balance sheet through accounting policy elections as long as the lease does not include options to purchase the underlying assets that are reasonably certain to be exercised.
The standard is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2020.
The amendment is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients, with early adoption permitted.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-04, Liabilities—Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20): Recognition of Breakage for Certain Prepaid Stored-Value Products, which amends existing guidance on extinguishing financial liabilities for certain prepaid stored-value products.
The new standard requires recognition of the expected breakage amount or the value that is ultimately not redeemed either proportionally in earnings as redemption occurs or when redemption is remote, if issuers are not entitled to breakage.
The standard is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2019.
The amendment is to be applied either using a modified retrospective approach by recognizing a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year or retrospectively to each period presented.
Early adoption is permitted.
7

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
An entity will recognize as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses, which is believed to result in more timely recognition of such losses as the standard eliminates the probable initial recognition threshold.
The standard is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2021.
The amendment is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which adopted.
Early adoption is permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2020.
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740), Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, which requires companies to account for the income tax effects of intercompany sales and transfers of assets other than inventory when the transfer occurs.
Current guidance requires companies to defer the income tax effects of intercompany transfers of assets until the asset has been sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized.
The standard is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2019.
The amendment is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach.
Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period.
In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-07, Compensation - Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, which changes how employers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other postretirement benefit plans present the net periodic benefit cost in the income statement.
The new guidance requires the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be presented in the same income statement line items as other employee compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period with only the service cost component eligible for capitalization in assets.
These components are not eligible for capitalization in assets.
The standard is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2019.
The amendment is to be applied retrospectively.
Early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an annual period.
In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting, which clarifies when changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award must be accounted for as modifications.
Modification guidance must be applied if the fair value, vesting conditions or classification of the awards changes.
The standard is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2019.
The amendment is to be applied prospectively to an award modified on or after the adoption date, with early adoption permitted.
In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
The standard is required to be adopted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period, which is our fiscal year 2020.
Adopted



In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which modifies existing requirements regarding measuring inventory at the lower of cost or market.
We adopted ASU 2015-11 on a prospective basis for the annual period ending September 29, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period.
8

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
We adopted ASU No.
2016-09 for the annual period ending September 29, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period.
Certain aspects of the amendment were applied using a retrospective transition method, while others were applied prospectively.
The adoption of this standard resulted in an increase in cash flows from operating activities and a decrease of cash flows from financing activities of $208 for fiscal year 2017 and $187 for fiscal year 2016 for the reclassification from financing activities to operating activities of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
Additionally, we elected to modify our accounting policy for forfeitures on stock-based awards to record forfeitures when the forfeiture occurs instead of recording stock-based compensation expense based on an estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, which provides guidance on the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments with the objective of reducing diversity in practice.
We early adopted ASU No.
2016-15 on a retrospective basis for the annual period ending September 29, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period.
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No.
2017-01, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business, which changes the definition of a business to assist entities with evaluating when a set of transferred assets and activities is a business.
We early adopted ASU 2017-01 on a prospective basis for the annual period ending September 29, 2018, including interim periods within that annual period.
NOTE 3 INVENTORIES 



Inventories consist of material, labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined under the first-in, first-out accounting method.
Certain inventories are measured using the weighted average cost method.
Inventories, net were as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



NOTE 4 WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS 



Sales of our products and systems are subject to limited warranty obligations that are included in customer contracts.
For sales that include installation services, warranty obligations generally extend for a period of 12 to 24 months from the date of either shipment or acceptance based on the contract terms.
Product obligations generally extend for a period of 12 to 24 months from the date of purchase.
Under the terms of these warranties, we are obligated to repair or replace any components or assemblies deemed defective due to workmanship or materials.
The percentage applied reflects our historical warranty claims experience over the preceding 12-month period.
Both the experience percentage and the warranty liability are evaluated on an ongoing basis for adequacy.

NOTE 5 CAPITAL ASSETS 



Property and Equipment



Property and equipment, net are as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Assets held under capital leases, consisting of machinery and equipment, are recorded at the present value of minimum lease payments and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated life of the asset or the lease term.
Amortization of assets held as capital leases is included in depreciation expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.
Goodwill



Changes to the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Intangible Assets



Intangible assets are as follows:

[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Amortization expense recognized is as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



Estimated future amortization expense related to finite-lived intangible assets is as follows: 



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



Future amortization amounts presented above are estimates.
When considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, the following fair value hierarchy distinguishes between observable and unobservable inputs, which are categorized in one of the following levels:



•Level 1: Unadjusted quoted prices which are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities accessible to us at the measurement date.
•Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1, as this level provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while giving the lowest priority to Level 3.
11

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis



Financial assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis are as follows:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



1 Based on observable market transactions of spot currency rates and forward currency rates on equivalently-termed instruments.
Carrying amounts of the financial assets and liabilities are equal to the fair value.
See Note 7 for additional information on derivative financial instruments.
2 Based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and spot rates.
Carrying amount of the financial asset is equal to the fair value.
See Note 7 for additional information on derivative financial instruments.
Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis



We measure certain financial instruments at fair value on a nonrecurring basis.
These assets primarily include goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets acquired either as part of a business acquisition, individually or with a group of other assets, as well as property and equipment.
These assets were initially measured and recognized at amounts equal to the fair value determined as of the date of acquisition or purchase subject to changes in value only for foreign currency translation.
Periodically, these assets are tested for impairment by comparing their respective carrying values to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or asset group in which they reside.
In the event any of these assets were to become impaired, we would recognize an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit, impaired asset or asset group exceeds its estimated fair value.
Fair value measurements of the reporting units associated with our goodwill balances and our indefinite-lived intangible assets are estimated at least annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year for purposes of impairment testing if a quantitative analysis is performed.
See Note 5 for additional information on goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, other long-lived assets and property and equipment.
Assets and Liabilities Not Measured at Fair Value



Certain financial instruments are not measured at fair value but are recorded at carrying amounts approximating fair value based on their short-term nature or variable interest rate.
These financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings.
12

Other Financial Instruments



Other financial instruments subject to fair value measurements include debt, which is recorded at carrying value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The estimated fair value of these long-term obligations is not necessarily indicative of the amount that would be realized in a current market exchange.
See Note 12 for additional information on the TEUs.
2 The fair value of the tranche B term loan is based on the most recently quoted market price for the outstanding debt instrument, adjusted for any known significant deviations in value.
The estimated fair value of the debt obligation is not necessarily indicative of the amount that would be realized in a current market exchange.
NOTE 7 DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES 



Our currency exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and qualify as hedging instruments.
We also have derivatives which are not designated as cash flow hedges and, therefore, are accounted for and reported under foreign currency guidance.
Regardless of designation for accounting purposes, we believe all of our derivative instruments are hedges of transactional risk exposures.
Cash Flow Hedging – Currency Risks



Currency exchange contracts utilized to maintain the functional currency value of expected financial transactions denominated in foreign currencies are designated as cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of the cash flow hedges represents the change in fair value of the hedge that offsets the change in the functional currency value of the hedged item.
We periodically assess whether our currency exchange contracts are effective and, when a contract is determined to be no longer effective as a hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.
Subsequent changes in the market value of ineffective currency exchange contracts are recognized as an increase or decrease in revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Income as that is the same line item in which the underlying hedged transaction is reported.
As of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we had outstanding cash flow hedge currency exchange contracts with gross notional U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of $44,890 and $29,136, respectively.
Upon netting offsetting contracts to sell foreign currencies against contracts to purchase foreign currencies, irrespective of contract maturity dates, the net notional U.S. dollar equivalent amount of contracts outstanding was $39,951 and $24,093 as of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
As of December 30, 2017, the net market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts was a net liability of $369, consisting of $151 in assets and $520 in liabilities.
As of September 30, 2017, the net market value of the foreign currency exchange contracts was a net liability of $478, consisting of $73 in assets and $551 in liabilities.
As of December 30, 2017, the amount projected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings in the next 12 months was a net loss of $438.
The maximum remaining maturity of any forward or optional contract as of December 30, 2017 was 2.1 years.
Interest Rate Swaps



On October 20, 2016, we entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement to mitigate our exposure to interest rate increases related to a portion of our tranche B term loan facility.
The total notional amount of the interest rate swap was $255,000 as of December 30, 2017.
The swap agreement expires April 3, 2021.
As a result of this agreement, every month we pay fixed interest at 1.256% in exchange for interest received at one month U.S. LIBOR.
The market value of the interest rate swap as of December 30, 2017 was an asset of $5,027.
The interest rate swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge.
As a result, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recorded in AOCI within shareholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Foreign Currency Balance Sheet Derivatives



We also use foreign currency derivative contracts to maintain the functional currency value of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional foreign currencies.
As of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we had outstanding foreign currency balance sheet derivative contracts with gross notional U.S. dollar equivalent amounts of $48,441 and $52,208, respectively.
Upon netting offsetting contracts by counterparty banks to sell foreign currencies against contracts to purchase foreign currencies, irrespective of contract maturity dates, the net notional U.S. dollar equivalent amount of contracts outstanding as of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017 was $14,990 and $14,762, respectively.
As of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, the net market value of the foreign exchange balance sheet derivative contracts was a net liability of $21 and a net asset of $77, respectively.
The net gain (loss) recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income on foreign exchange balance sheet derivative contracts is as follows:

Tranche B Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility



We have a credit agreement with U.S. Bank National Association and HSBC Bank USA, National Association as Co-Documentation Agents, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as Syndication Agent, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
as Administrative Agent and JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A.
and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC as Joint Bookrunners and Joint Lead Arrangers (the Credit Agreement).
The Credit Agreement provides for senior secured credit facilities consisting of a $120,000 revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility) which expires on July 5, 2021 and a $460,000 tranche B term loan facility (the Term Facility) which expires on July 5, 2023.
The proceeds of the Revolving Credit Facility can be drawn upon to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital and other general corporate purposes up to a maximum of $120,000.
The proceeds of the Term Facility were used for financing the acquisition of PCB Group, Inc. (PCB) in fiscal year 2016.
The Term Facility amortizes in equal quarterly installments equal to 1% of the original principal amount.
The primary categories of borrowing include Alternate Base Rate (ABR) Borrowing (ABR Term Loans and ABR Revolving Loans), Swingline Loans and Eurocurrency Borrowing (each as defined in the Credit Agreement).
ABR Borrowings and Swingline Loans made in U.S. dollars under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the ABR plus the Applicable Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
The ABR is defined as the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day, (b) the New York Federal Reserve Bank (NYFRB) rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) in effect on such day plus ½ of 1.00%, or (c) the Adjusted LIBOR (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for a one-month interest period in dollars on such day plus 1.00%.
The ABR for ABR Term Loans shall not be less than 1.75% per annum.
The Applicable Rate for any ABR Revolving Loans will be based upon the leverage ratio applicable on such date.
As of December 30, 2017, the Applicable Rate for ABR Term Loans was 2.25% per annum.
Eurocurrency Borrowings made under the Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Adjusted LIBOR Rate plus the Applicable Rate.
The Adjusted LIBOR Rate is defined as an interest rate per annum equal to (a) the LIBOR Rate for such interest period multiplied by (b) the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement).
The Applicable Rate for any Eurocurrency Revolving Loan is based upon the leverage ratio applicable on such date.
The Adjusted LIBOR Rate for Eurocurrency Term Loans shall not be less than 0.75% per annum.
Based on our leverage ratio as of December 30, 2017, the Applicable Rate for Eurocurrency Revolving Loans was 3.00%.
As of December 30, 2017, the Applicable Rate for Eurocurrency Term Loans was 3.25% per annum, plus the applicable Adjusted LIBOR Rate of 1.44%.
The weighted average interest rate on Term Facility debt during the three months ended December 30, 2017 was 4.54%.
16

Outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were $5,000 and $0, as of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively, reported in short-term borrowings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
We had outstanding letters of credit drawn from the Revolving Credit Facility totaling $43,381 and $37,811 as of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively, leaving approximately $71,619 and $82,189, respectively, of unused borrowing capacity.
Commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit Facility at rates between 0.25% and 0.40% based on our leverage ratio.
During the three months ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, commitment fees incurred totaled $79 and $101, respectively.
The Credit Agreement governing the Term Facility requires us to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, depending on the leverage ratio with (a) up to 50% of the Company's annual Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Credit Agreement) and (b) 100% of the net cash proceeds of (i) certain asset sales and casualty and condemnation events, subject to reinvestment rights and certain other exceptions; and (ii) any incurrence or issuance of certain debt, other than debt permitted under the Credit Agreement.
All obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company's existing wholly owned domestic subsidiaries, and are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Company's subsidiary guarantors.
The Credit Agreement also contains financial covenants, including the ratio of consolidated total indebtedness to adjusted consolidated earnings before income, taxes, depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA), as defined in the Credit Agreement, as well as the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated interest expense.
As of December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with these financial covenants.
See Note 6 for additional information on the fair value of the tranche B term loan and the TEU debt.
Interest Rate Swaps



On October 20, 2016, in order to mitigate our exposure to interest rate increases on our variable rate debt, we entered into a variable to fixed amortizing interest rate swap.
See Note 7 for additional information on derivative financial instruments.
The interest rate swap will be reduced to the following notional amounts over the next five years:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]



NOTE 9 STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION



We compensate our officers, directors and employees with stock-based compensation under the 2017 Stock Incentive Plan (the 2017 Plan) approved by our shareholders and administered under the supervision of our Board of Directors.
As of December 30, 2017, a total of 1,595 shares were available for issuance under the 2017 Plan.
In fiscal year 2018, we adopted ASU No.
2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.
See Note 2 for additional information regarding the impact of adoption.
Stock Options



There were no stock options granted during the three months ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
Restricted Stock Units and Performance Restricted Stock Units



We award restricted stock units to directors and key employees and performance restricted stock units to key employees.
During the three months ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we granted approximately 1,294 restricted stock units to officers and employees and 2 restricted stock units to employees, respectively.
There were no performance restricted stock units granted during the three months ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan



Our U.S. employees are eligible to participate in the 2012 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (2012 ESPP) approved by our shareholders.
As of December 30, 2017, a total of 639 shares were available for issuance under the 2012 ESPP.
During the three months ended December 30, 2017, we issued no shares under the 2012 ESPP.
NOTE 10 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS



We sponsor a non-contributory, defined benefit retirement plan for eligible employees of one of our German subsidiaries.
Net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plan included the following components:



[DATA_TABLE_REMOVED] 



The weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for each of the three months ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was 5.5%.
Excluding the impact of these discrete benefits, the effective tax rate for the three months ended December 30, 2017 decreased compared to the prior year primarily due to the lower U.S. corporate tax rate under the Tax Act.
The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
118 (SAB 118) which allows registrants to record provisional amounts during a one-year measurement period.
Amounts recorded where the accounting is provisional during the three months ended December 30, 2017 include the remeasurement of other deferred taxes where the timing of the reversal cannot be known at this time.
18

The full-year estimated annual effective tax rate, which excludes the impact of discrete items, was 17.3% as of December 30, 2017, as compared to 21.8% as of December 31, 2016.
NOTE 12 SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY



Tangible Equity Units



During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we issued 1,150 TEUs in a registered public offering primarily to finance the acquisition of PCB, to repay amounts outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility and to pay related costs, fees and expenses.
Total proceeds, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses were $110,926.
Each TEU has a stated amount of $100 per TEU and is comprised of a prepaid stock purchase contract and a senior amortizing note having a final installment payment date of July 1, 2019.
We allocated the proceeds from the issuance of the TEUs between equity and debt based on the relative fair values of the respective components of each TEU.
The fair value of the prepaid stock purchase contracts, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses, was recorded in additional paid-in capital in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
The fair value of the senior amortizing note, net of underwriting discounts, commissions and other expenses, was split between current maturities of long-term debt, net and long-term debt, less current maturities, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
Underwriting discounts, commissions and other costs directly associated with the TEU-related debt will be amortized using the effective interest rate method over the three year term of the instrument.
The aggregate values assigned upon issuance to each component of the TEUs, based on the relative fair value of the respective components, were as follows:

1 The fair value price allocation between equity and debt for each TEU was determined using a discounted cash flow model.
Equity Component



Unless converted earlier at the option of the holder, each prepaid stock purchase contract will automatically settle on July 1, 2019.
If converted prior to the automatic settlement date at the option of the holder, the minimum of 1.9841 shares of our common stock are delivered to the holder of each prepaid stock purchase contract.
On the automatic settlement date, a minimum of 1.9841 shares and a maximum of 2.3810 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment based upon the applicable market value discussed below, will be delivered to the holder of each prepaid stock purchase contract at the settlement date.
The number of shares of our common stock issuable upon settlement of each purchase contract on July 1, 2019 will be determined as follows: [DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED][DATA_TABLE_REMOVED]

The "applicable market value" is defined as the average of the daily volume-weighted average price of the common stock on each of the 20 consecutive trading days beginning on, and including, the 23rd scheduled trading day immediately preceding July 1, 2019.
During the three months ended December 30, 2017, no holders of our TEUs elected to early convert the equity component of our outstanding TEUs.
There were 677 units of the equity component of TEUs outstanding as of both December 30, 2017 and September 30, 2017.
Debt Component



The amortizing senior note was issued with an initial principal amount of $27,386 or $23.8136 per TEU.
Equal quarterly cash installments of $2.1875 per amortizing note will be paid, which in the aggregate will be equivalent to a 8.75% cash distribution per year with respect to each $100 stated amount per TEU.
Each installment will constitute a payment of interest and partial repayment of principal.
The 1.9841 minimum shares to be issued are included in the calculation of basic weighted average shares outstanding.
The 0.3969 difference between the minimum shares and the 2.3810 maximum shares are potentially dilutive, and accordingly, are included in our diluted earnings per share on a pro rata basis to the extent the applicable market value is higher than the reference price but less than the threshold appreciation price.
See Note 13 for additional information regarding the calculation of earnings per share.
Capped Calls



In connection with the pricing of the TEUs sold in our public offering in fiscal year 2016, we purchased capped calls from third party banking institutions (Capped Calls) for $7,935.
The initial Capped Calls were for 2,282 equivalent shares of our common stock with a strike price of $50.40, a cap price of $58.80 and an expiration date of July 1, 2019 (Capped Call Expiration).
During the three months ended December 30, 2017, no Capped Calls were settled.
Settlement of the Capped Calls prior to Capped Call Expiration may be for fewer shares than the maximum of 293 shares.
NOTE 13 EARNINGS PER SHARE 



Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the daily weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the applicable period.
The TEUs are assumed to be settled at the minimum settlement amount of 1.9841 shares per TEU when calculating weighted-average common shares outstanding for purposes of basic earnings per share.
Using the treasury stock method, diluted earnings per share includes the potentially dilutive effect of common shares issued in connection with outstanding stock-based compensation options and grants.
The potentially dilutive effect of common shares issued in connection with outstanding stock options is determined based on the average market price for the period.
Under the treasury stock method, shares associated with certain stock options have been excluded from the diluted weighted average shares outstanding calculation because the exercise of those options would lead to a net reduction in common shares outstanding or anti-dilution.
As a result, stock options to acquire 496 and 663 weighted common shares have been excluded from the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding calculation for the three months ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively.
In connection with the pricing of the TEUs, we purchased Capped Calls.
The Capped Calls will not be reflected in the calculation of diluted earnings per share until settled as they are anti-dilutive.

In evaluating each segment's performance, our Chief Executive Officer focuses on income from operations.
On January 5, 2017, we announced the division of our Test segment into two separate business units, "Materials Test Systems" and "Vehicles and Structure Test Systems."
The division of our Test segment will result in us having three operating segments once discrete financial information is made available to our Chief Operating Decision Maker.
We will continue to report only the Test and Sensors segments until such time.
We continue to evaluate the timing of such implementation.
Financial information by reportable segment is as follows:

NOTE 16 RESTRUCTURING AND RELATED COSTS



During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we initiated a series of Test workforce reductions and facility closures intended to increase organizational effectiveness, gain manufacturing efficiencies and provide cost savings that can be reinvested in our growth initiatives.
As a result, in the three months ended December 30, 2017, we recorded $93 of pre-tax severance and related expense and $162 of pre-tax facility closure costs.
For the remainder of fiscal year 2018, we expect to incur $1,000 to $3,000 of additional pre-tax severance and related expenses and facility closure costs related to these actions.
The majority of the expenses are expected to be paid in fiscal year 2018.
During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, in an effort to reduce costs and create economic efficiencies in Sensors, we initiated plans to close our Machida, Japan sales office in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018.
In the three months ended December 30, 2017, we recorded an immaterial adjustment to the severance and related expense reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017.
